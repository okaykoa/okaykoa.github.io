Coffee with Caroline vol. 1

**Description :** This coffee is reminiscent of a latte, but idk what actually makes a latte. The cardamom provides a pleasant bitterness, bringing out the robustness of your coffee beans, and is sweetened by a subtle vanilla foam.

**Tasting notes:** Coffee, Cardamom, Vanilla, Half and half

**Renders:** 2 mugs

**Time to prepare:** idk like 15 minutes

**You will need:**
- Coffee
- Ground Cardamom
- Half and half
- Vanilla syrup
- French press

## 1. Boil some water

You might have a nice electric kettle or a stovetop that works much faster than Caroline's, in which case you may not need to do this first. But this is a pretty good time to start thinking about hot water since you're making coffee.

_*Now would also be a good time to turn on music for good vibes if you haven't already._

## 2. Grind the beans

Coarsely grind 5 scoops of coffee. 

_*Caroline recommends CafÃ© Mam's [Trinity Blend](https://cafemam.com/products/trinity-blend?_pos=1&_sid=822c976e7&_ss=r), a mix of French, Italian, and medium roast beans._ 

## 3. Add grounds and cardamom to the french press

Add the coffee grounds to a french press with 1/4 teaspoon of ground cardamom.

_*This is a great time to smooch your pup, cat, or significant other if you haven't already._

## 4. Brew the coffee

Pour boiled water into the french press aggressively to stir up the grounds a bit.

Let sit for about a minute before stirring with a wooden stirring device, then let the coffee brew for a few minutes (don't forget about your coffee; that would be embarassing ðŸ™ƒ).

_*Caroline recommends avoiding using a metallic stirring device. She doesn't know why. She heard once that you should use a wooden stirring device and follows that advice blindly._

## 5. Prepare the foam

Add some half and half and vanilla syrup (roughly 1 cup and 1 tbsp respeectively) to a tall microwaveable glass.

Warm up the vanilla half and half in the microwave for 30 seconds.

Froth the half and half until it is "nice" and "foamy."

_*Caroline looked it up and read that using a metal stirring device can chip or crack your glass french press._

## 6. Serve 

Half plunge, then unplunge, then full plunge the french press.

Then pour coffee into a mug, adding vanilla foam to taste (this isn't meant to be a sweet coffee, so go easy on the foam and embrace the bitterness of this cardamom coffee).

Enjoy!
