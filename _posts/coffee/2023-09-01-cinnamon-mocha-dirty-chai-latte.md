Coffee with Caroline vol. 2

This coffee goes several names ("Chai don't know", "The one", "That one with the mocha and chai that's really good"), but its official name is "TO and the Holy Chai Don't Know Nothings" (It's a [band reference](https://www.tkandtheholyknownothings.com/)).

**Description :** This is a complex, sweet, and chocolately dirty chai. The chai spices are heavily featured, enhanced by a cinnamon foam, and balanced with mocha and vanilla.

**Tasting notes:** Chai, Mocha, Cinnamon, Vanilla

**Renders:** 2 mugs

**Time to prepare:** like 12 minutes or something

## 1. Make coffee

Actually, you should probably start by boiling some water.

## 1. Boil some water

In the last coffee post, I mentioned how Caroline's stove heats up pretty slowly, so it's good to start with the water. You can do this step a little later if you have like a super fast electric kettle or something (I have a super fast electric kettle at home ðŸ˜Œ).

## 1. _Actually_, actually, turn on some good music first

Actually, it's probably best to have turned on some good tunes first because it's going to take few minutes to make this coffee and good music will set the tone for a good day.

Do all step 1's in reverse order, then proceed to step 2.

## 2. Grind the beans

Using your grinding tool of choice, grind your beans to a medium coarseness. 

How much coffee? Caroline says:

> Many scoops. Because we will not make the mistake of making weak-ass coffee again. But I think it was four scoops. Idk if I counted.
> 
> umm... 

_*This is probably a great time to take a picture of your cute dog or pet. At least that's what Caroline got distracted by..._

Then add your grounds to the french press.

## 3. Prepare the chai mix

Whilst the water is being boiled or the coffee steeping, prepare your mugs with the chai mix.

Using "my small kitchen spoon, the one from my silverware set, the small one" (for reference, Caroline's teaspoons are smaller than an imperial table spoon and larger than a teaspoon--we measured it), add one unlevelled spoonful of Orca Spice chai and one spoonful of Black Rhino chai plus a little bit more. So, just a bit more cocoa chai than regular chai.

_*Impatiently wait for your boyfriend or parter to finish taking notes before moving to the next step._

## 4. Brew the coffee

If you planned ahead, you're probably waiting for your coffee to steep rn. If not, pour your boiling water into the french press and let the coffee steep for 4-5 minutes.

When the coffee is ready--"mind you that a minute before the coffee was ready, I stirred it with a wooden utensil"--half plunge, unplunge, then full plunge the french press.

## 5. Prepare the foam

In a tall microwavable glass, add a little half and half and a spooful of cinnamon vanilla syrup. Then set it aside.

Once the coffee is about ready to pour, heat up the half and half in the microwave (pronounced _"me crow wahvay"_).

### 5. Froth the foam

In step 6, you will be instructed to come back here and froth the foam. Sorry, Caroline forgot this step until now.

_*But don't froth it too early bc if it sits too long, it looses its foamyness._

## 6. Put it all together

Fill your mugs about halfway with coffee.

_*Jam to the good tunes you turned on earlier._

Froth the coffee cocoa mix in the mug.

Once the chai is fully integrated into the coffee, top off the mugs with remaining coffee, leaving some room for the foamy half and half.

> Which reminds me, we should foam the half and half.

_* Go back to step 5 and foam the half and half._

Top off your coffee with cinnamon vanilla foamy goodness.

Voila! You have a signature "TO and the Holy Chai Dont Know Nothings" or whatever tf this coffee is called.
