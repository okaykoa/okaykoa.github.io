I have some ideas.

## Ship in a Bottle Tattoo

So, instead of getting a tattoo of a standard ship in a bottle, you could go with a quirky alternative:

1. One of your favorite sci-fi spaceships in a bottle (Millenium Falcon, USS Enterprise, etc.).
2. A shipping box with the label "CONTENTS: 1 BOTTLE".
3. An empty bottle with bits of a model ship and another tattoo of an incomplete model ship (ie. Ship of Theseus in a Bottle).

## Product Idea: Ship of Theseus in a Bottle

It's just a regular ship in a bottle. Except, the ship in the bottle is delivered preassembled and the ship is delivered with an additional bag of model ship parts.

You are meant to use the extra parts to replace the parts on the assembled ship one-by-one.

In the end, you must decide which of your model ships is the Ship of Theseus.
