TL;DR--test your smoke detectors after replacing the batteries to stop them from chirping.

This is an important DIY/Self-help post.

If your smoke detectors start chirping, you probably need to replace the batteries. 

If you've replaced the batteries and your smoke detectors are still chirping, you should look for the solutions to your problem online. What I found is that you may have to disconnect your smoke detector from all power sources and drain the remaining charge by holding the test button for 15 seconds. Everything that I found online said that this would work: it didn't.

This may be common knowledge, but it didn't ever come up in any Google search I found and it stopped my smoke detectors from chirping: test your smoke detector after replacing the batteries. For me, this meant holding the test button until the alarm I was testing, and the other alarms in the house, started beeping as if there was a fire. Thesting both of the alarms that had low batteries stopped all the chirping in my house.

Extra tip: wear ear plugs while you test. Damn that was loud.
