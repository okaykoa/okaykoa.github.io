TL;DR--test your smoke detectors after replacing the batteries to stop them from chirping.

This is an important DIY/Self-help post.

## 1. My smoke detectors are chriping ðŸ™„

If your smoke detectors start chirping, you probably need to replace the batteries. 

## 2. Umm... They're still chirping ðŸ˜’

If you've replaced the batteries and your smoke detectors are still chirping, you should look for the solutions to your problem online. 

What I found is that you may have to disconnect your smoke detector from all power sources and drain the remaining charge by holding the test button for 15 seconds. Everything that I found online said that this would work: it didn't.

## 3. I'm frustrated bc they're _still_ chirping ðŸ˜¡

This may be common knowledge, but it didn't come up in any Google search I found and it stopped my smoke detectors from chirping: 

**Test your smoke detector after replacing the batteries.**

For me, this meant holding the test button until the alarm I was testing, and the other alarms in the house, started beeping as if there was a fire. Testing both of the alarms that had low batteries stopped all the chirping in my house.

## 4. Hopefully they're not chirping any more ðŸ¤ž

Extra tip: wear ear plugs while you test. Damn that was loud.

For more life tips, call your dad or something idk.
