If "life is worth living," this means that the value of life must be worth the cost of living.

This doesn't necessarily entail that life is of high value. It could be true, for example, that life is of little value but the cost of living is of even lesser value.

I think that for many, the higher the value of life, the higher the cost of living. I think the very act of considering the cost of living increases that cost, and any insights one can provide about the cost of living increase the value of one's life if for no other reason than the perspective they can provide (though a variety of value probably derrives from such insights).

It's been a while since I read Victor Frankl's, "Man's Search for Meaning," but if I recall anything, it's that Frankl believes that if a person knows their purpose in life, they will have a much stronger will to go on living. Even in the face of terrible tribulation, so long as person has a reason to go on--a strong enough reason to go on--they will.

I don't mean to dismiss the many valid reasons people question whether their life is worth living. There are many difficult lives of which I haven't the slightest understanding. I don't mean to trivialize the high cost of living such difficult lives. 

Just as Frankl believes a person knows why they _should_ go on living, Albert Camus posited that there are a number worthy causes to die. Though Camus himself would disagree, I believe a life that fails to provide the value that matches the cost of living could quite easily be worthy of such cause (i.e. the escape from pain is just as valid as fulfilling the call to virtue). 

I believe the value of a life is subjective to each person. While there are several components that we can assess externally and agree are valuable and of worth, the experience of "a life worth living" is up to the transactional relationship between one's subjective experience of the value of their life and the subjective experience of the cost of living it. I don't beleive in a trascendental divine value of life, but I could concede to a minimum "value of life" instrinsic to itself. But hand-in-hand with such necessary value is the equally intrinsic cost of living, which may possibly exceed that intrinsic value of life. No one can make a definitive case about whether another's life is worth living; the calculation must, at day's end, belong to the person who experiences that personal subjective value.

Suicide is a sad thing. The feelings and experiences that lead one to such an act are unpleasant for strangers, sorrowful for loved ones, and uncanny to those who think--a little too much--about the longing for respite. But this thought and short essay isn't meant solely to answer the question, "to be or not to be?"

For those of us fortunate enough to have many options in life, we must decide not only which option will be worth living, but which among several livable options we will choose. Whether right or wrong, how will we live with it? And if we are currently living a life which is not worth it, can we possibly choose another one before quitting altogether?

I believe Victor, Albert, and I would be in agreement; we hope you do choose to try another one.
