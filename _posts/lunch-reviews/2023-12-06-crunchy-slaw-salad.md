**Rating:** ★★★★★★★★★☆

**Price:** $5.99

**Review:**

This salad is a top-tier Asian adjacent salad. The flavor profile is mostly savory, with a subtle hint of sweetness from the peanut dressing. The greens are crispy, which is to be expected from cabbage, aided by the very crispy fried chow mein noodles. The protein was pretty subtle compared to the rest of the salad, but in my experience that's for the better when it comes to Trader Joe's shaker salads.

Overall, this is a hearty, savory salad that I will definitely be having again.
