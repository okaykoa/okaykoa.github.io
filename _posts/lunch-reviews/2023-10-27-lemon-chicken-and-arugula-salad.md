**Review:**

This salad is just okay. It's a cold shaker salad, which can be very enjoyable, but something about the flavor profile of the ingredients of this salad was unpleasant with the format. The arugula was pretty good, nice and bitter with a good degree of bite. I think it's mostly the dressing that is overpoweringly sweet. The couscous was just a little on the mushy side, which wasn't the most unpleasant or unexpected, but still contribute to a mild reception. The chicken was a little on the soft and bland side, which it par for prepackaged chicken breast. It was reminiscent of canned chicken. 

Overall, the typical Trader Joe's price point makes most of their products a decent value, but I wouldn't recommend this item as one of TJ's strongest lunch picks.
