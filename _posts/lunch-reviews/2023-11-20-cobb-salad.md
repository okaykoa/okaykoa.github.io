**Rating:** ★★★★★★★☆☆☆

**Description:** Cobb salad with grilled chicken breast, uncured bacon, bleu and gorgonzola cheeses, and ranch dressing.

**Price:** $?.?? I will have to check next time (: 

**Review:**

This salad was very bold, particularly in the cheese profile. The bleu and gorgonzola cheeses were very pungent and constituted the strongest flavor of this salad. The greens were a little sad, though they tasted fresh. They just lacked the typicall crunch I am used to from a TJ salad. The chicken in this salad was much better thn the proteins found in other TJ salads. I think the bacan and ranch made the usually dry chicken more enjoyable. 

Overall, this was a pretty good salad. It was a bit hearty ans pungent, but for the price, I think it's a solid go to for a salad lunch.
