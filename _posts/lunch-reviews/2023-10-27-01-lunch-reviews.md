I was walking through the Trader Joe's produce section, looking for a quick bag salad to make for dinner, when I noticed just how large the TJ premade salad section is. Like, there is an alarming variety of salads at Trader Joe's. 

So, I deciding I'm going to try them all. 

But, instead of limiting this endeavor to Trader Joe's items, I want to give myself the freedom to review items of this nature from all sorts of brands and companies. I'll make sure to include the brand, store, etc. with each review. 

🥗🍴
