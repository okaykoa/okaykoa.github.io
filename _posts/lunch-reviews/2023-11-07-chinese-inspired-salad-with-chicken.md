**Review:**

This was a sad salad... To TJ's credit, all the greens were crispy and flavorful. The best part of this salad was the snow peas, which were cripsy and sweet (for a vegetable, of course). BUT, the overall experience of the salad was very sad. The dressing, which--let's be honest--should have been doing the heavy lifting in a salad, was a very lackluster, almost lazy, contribution to the salad. The dressing was very watered down, providing more of a soy and sesame essence than it dressed the salad. It was almost like La Croix entered the flat water market and decided the next best flavor was soy sauce... In addition to the poor-performing dressing was the TJ salad trademark sad protein. This review sounds overly dramatic (probably inspired by my current first viewing of Schitt's Creek, ew David), but it really wasn't a good salad. 

Overall, I wouldn't buy this again, though if I was really desperate for something green and fresh, regardless of taste, it is certainly edible.
