**Review:**

This salad was very good. I enjoyed just about every bite, even though the shake method didn't work very well for this salad, and much of the greens were not dressed. All the greens tasted very fresh and had a full flavor that was enjoyable, even for the dryer parts of the salad. I don't think the salad had any cheese, which is typically a strong plus for me, but it was still very flavorful. The miso dressing was sweet, and not overly so, making for a very enjoyable flavor profile. Honestly--and this is quite sad--the only part of the salad that was below expectation was the salmon. It was a bit dry and flavorless, which was a big dissapointment given the salad's price as well as the excellent execution in the rest of the composition. Even though the salmon was underwhelming, the salad still came together nicely as a whole. 

Overall, this was a very good salad. It is definitely not the most economical choice for a TJ salad, but it was very tasty. If money is no object for you, this is a good salad to treat yourself with.
