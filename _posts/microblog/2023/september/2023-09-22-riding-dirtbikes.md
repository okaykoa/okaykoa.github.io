It's been a while since I've taken the time to write. Along with still recovering from an illness last week, I have been busy with work and other items that have been taking up space in my mind. 

Yesterday, I took the day off and my partner and I headed to southern Utah where we rented dirtbikes and an instructor to teach us how to ride them. I have some experience riding street bikes, but neither of us had any experience riding off road and Caroline had no experience on a motorcycle at all. 

We had so much fun. It only took her about an hour before she was spinning circles around the area where she was learing to ride. Then we headed over to a larger area and just rode around in the dirt and climbed some small hills. There were so many times when she just sent it up a hill that even I was a little nervous to take on. She really is such a badass. 

It's things like this that make me feel so lucky to be with her. We have so much fun with every activity that we try. I'm not sure if I was able to write about it, but last week we went to the batting cages. She was so cool and got right back in the groove, even having been out of practice for a decade. And she looked so hot driving liners stright to the back of the cage. ðŸ¥µ

Work has been a bit busy. There have been some new things added to my responsibilities. These are mostly things that I was excited to take on about a year ago. But as time has gone on, more requests have come across my desk, increasing the amount of work I need to take care of on the fronts I used to own and on the fronts I have taken on in my eagerness. Today I had a one on one meeting with my boss and we basically created a 3-year plan for one of my initiatives. We were able to define the plan from the beginning, including the next couple weeks and extending out for a good amount of time. Fortunately, we have a team of devs who are the perfect fit for the steps along the way. I am really excited to be moving forward with this plan, even if it means I will continue to be pretty busy for the forseeable future.

Fortunately, I have a pretty solid relationship with work at the moment. I really do enjoy what I do, and sometimes I'm a bit busier than I would like to be. But I also have a lot of flexibility in the way I engage with my work. And that flexibility allows me to prioritize the things that are important to me. So I'm getting a lot of stuff done but I don't let my job creep up on the list of real priorities in my life; and I feel like I'm very fortunate that this is the relationship that I have with work. 

Sometimes I wish more people prioritized work a bit less. I don't think that efficiency or productivity is nearly as important as people treat it or view it. But, I understand that I'm coming from a pretty high place of priveledge in this opinion. Most people don't have the flexibility to engage with their work as a low priority. For many, work is a demanding aspect of their life and the most important parts of it depend on their work. I think of people with kids who have a hard time finding time to be present in those kids' lives. Work can be really demanding without even truly meeting the needs of those dependent on the salary. Meanwhile I'm wishing that people could have the same loose relationship I have with my own work. 

It may be a cliche at this point, but capitalism and consumerism really are big problems in our world. There are far more pressing problems across the world that affect millions of people, meanwhile a handful of economic elites drive other millions of people to waste their time with meaningless wasteful wage labor. I sincerely wish that work was motivated by the good that it could do in the world rather than the margins that it can make on production, environmental costs be damned...

I really am fortunate, and sometimes I don't know what to do with my good fortune.
