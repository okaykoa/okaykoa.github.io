I find myself writing on an airplane today. I don't have a wifi connection, so this post will be uploadd after the fact. I am going home today to visit my family. My little brothers have sports games this weekend, and this is the primary reason I am going home. 

One of my brothers is a great football player. I thought he would have been on his way to a competetive college for football. He is not very big, but he is fast and strong. He stands out, even at his 4A school that is good a football. 

Though, unfortunately, I haven't ever seen him play in a tackle game. When he was little I watched all of his flag football games, but I have lived out of the state for all of his high school years. As much as I have intended on making it back home to catch some of his games, There are several things that have made that difficult. I wish I had been able to make it to a game before this. 

Luckily, I will be able to see one of his football games and one of my other brothers' tennis matches. 

I have had a very good relationship with my borthers ever since they were little. Now that I live out of state, it's more difficult for us to maintain a relationship. But fortunately online video games and other ways to keep in touch have been very useful in continuting to have a strong relationship with them. 

This as been true of my little sister as well. She moved out of the house last year to Nashville. The furthest away that any of us has lived from home. I guess maybe that's not true as my other little sister went to college in Hawaii, but the Nashville sister is there to stay. It's actually funny, only a couple months after my sister moved to Nashville, my parents bought a house out there. The timing played a big role as my parent's had just sold their house, my sister's childhood home, only a few months prior. That may have had something to do with my sister moving to Nashville.

Yesterday was a challenging day for me. I needed to get quite a few things done to be able to go on this trip. But I was also very busy at work yesterday. Working from home is a really nice convenience. I was able to start a load of lanudry while my code compiles and fold that laundry during a meeting, among other tasks that I was able to do while continuing to have a productive day at work. At the end of the day, I did have a bit of a headache from trying to keep so many things in mind, but I was happy with the number of things I was able to get done before my trip.

I looks like we're on our way down from the sky so I will end today's entry here.
