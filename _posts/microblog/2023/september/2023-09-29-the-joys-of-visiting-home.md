Going home is always a bit draining for me. I've been living on my own for several years now. And even though I moved home during grad school, I was really on my own shcedule at that point in my life and had been living on my own for years before that point as well. 

When I go home, there are lots of things going on as there are far more people in the house than I've had to live with for quite some time. And my philosophy on space and time is that people need their own. But at home, my dad has a very family-oriented view on time: that the whole family should be participating in time together as often as possible. 

It's nice to go home, and it's important to make the most of my time at home since I don't get to see everyone very often. But it is a draining experience for me. I'm looking forward to spending more time with my family in spite of being very tired this morning.
