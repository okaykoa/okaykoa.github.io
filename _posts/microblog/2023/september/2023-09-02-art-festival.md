Today was a lovely day :)

It started with a walk with my partner and her dog, and then we went to brunch at the Rose Establishment in SLC. It's a little cafe restaurant that we've been to before and really liked. They have a croque madame that is very good.

My partner had gotten all done up for our brunch date and an arts festival that was just down the street at the Gateway Mall. I have been wanting to take her to the Urban Arts Gallery for some time. Its a gallery with a bunch of stalls where local artists sell their work. There is a lot of cool stuff there, some pretty cool art that goes beyond the simple 2D space that I would typically engage with. But any time I've needed a birthday card or something like that, I've gone to the UAG to see if I could find something unique.

The festival was _really_ cool. We ended up buying a lot more than we had planned on, but we could have easily bought more!

One of my favorite parts was walking around the festival and seeing art that my partner and I recognized from different coffee shops around SLC. We would say to the artsits, "Hey, is your art for sale at [x coffee shop]?" and it was really cool to be able to tell them about times when their art had stuck out to us. One of the artists had done a piece that I bought for Caroline, so it was really cool to meet them and talk to them for a minute.

After that, the day got a little more "normal." I did have some time I needed to make up at work and I hung out with my partner's dog for a bit before heading home since he had been alone for most of the day. But that's always a pleasure in and of itself :)

I had some tidying and organizing to do later at night. I had hoped to go to bed at a reasonable hour, but that didn't end up being the case. But that was okay because I like to talk to Caroline when she gets off work and last night she didn't get off until midnight... So even though I would have liked to have been asleep by the time she was heading home, I was really happy to be able to talk to her when she was home.

Like I said, it was a good day :)
