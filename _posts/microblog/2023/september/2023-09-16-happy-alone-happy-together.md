Today I went to look at a house for sale with my partner. We have not been together very long, so it does feel early to be looking at properties together. We don't plan to buy anything soon, but we wanted to go and see what each other likes and dislikes in a property. It was a fun experience. I really enjoy being with her. I have not been this excited for life in a long time. 

I was happy on my own, and I was excited about things that I was working on, but I was disappointed that I didn't have someone to share life with. I always wanted to share life with a special partner. I finally found that with Caroline and it feels great. 

I did have some deep disappointments with life before I met Caroline, but I had figured out how to be happy on my own. I found a lot of pleasure in activities and projects, many of which I continue to enjoy today. Writing is one thing I would have liked to have done more of before I met her, and now that we have hit full stride together, she has helped me make more time in my life to write regularly. 

I do believe that people often think that a relationship will make them happy. People who are sad alone sometimes seek company in order to escape that sadness. But I do think that there is a lot of value in being able to be happy alone. One who can be happy alonw will have the capacity to be happy in a relationship. That's not to say that one comes before the other; I think that people often say they are avoiding relationships to work on themselves when they should take advantage of any opportunity to work on themselves, single or not. I just think that being in a relationship is a common demononator in the question of happiness--you can be happy in a relationship or happy out of a relationship. Therefore, a relationship isn't going to solve the problem. 

After we looked at one property, we went to breakfast. And while we were waiting to be seated we looked at some other properties and found another open house so we went to look at that house too. We liked it even more than the first. We didn't put any offers in or anything tho. We really aren't looking to buy anything any time soon, it's just looking together and getting to know each other better.  But I do know I would like to live with her some day.
