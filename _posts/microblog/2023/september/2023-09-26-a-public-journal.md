Yesterday was a pretty uneventful day. Instead of morning writing, I copied my journal entry from when I was up in the mountains into my public journal. What a silly concept. I supposed it's not novel; many people live their lives in this way today and many historical figures have had their journals published as public works. But something about me doing it, believing that my life is worth documentation, seems somehow strange. 

But then I think about the people whose journals and lives have been documented. In most cases they are extrordinary people, or at least, their documented lives found me becuase they were extraordinary. The promulgation of their stories was amplified becuase it was a story worth reading. But in every case, I wonder if the person was truly extraordinary or if their circumstances (and maybe even just their storytelling) were the extraordinary thing. 

As an example, and I mean no offense in considering this, Anne Frank was just a girl when she documented her family's story through the holocaust. Though her story is definitely one worth learning and contemplating, and again I mean no offense by this, I wonder is Anne Frank the person was extraordinary at her young age. I do wonder if it is the circumstance that made the person a story worth telling. And all taken into account, I wonder if Anne would have preferred to have been a person with a much more ordinary story than the one the world came to know through the publication of her private journal...

The sentiment that sticks with me in this thought is that all people have a story that they are living. And if we knew the intimate details of their experience, even the details of the more ordinary person, I wonder if we would find their circumstances something worth admiring, studying, and remembering. I wonder how many Anne Franks I haven't heard of and how many of them I've met in real life without knowing it. 

I'm not writing this public journal to be remembered--I think many of us would prefer to be forgotten in today's information age--I'm simply writing this public journal as an exercise in several hobbies I would like to take up. The pivotal of which is to write. But I don't always have easy things to write about, so I figured writing about my every day life, my thoughts, my experiences, my feelings would be enough to get me in the habit and practice of writing. Plus, even though my purpose is not to be documented publicly, I do want to be able to look back at my life and see how the story unfolds, how my efforts materialize. So, you're welcome, world. Here's my public journal for you to read.
