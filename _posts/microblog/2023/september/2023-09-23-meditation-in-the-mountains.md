Today I joined my friend Aadesh on a meditation retreat. He started an organization called Meditation in the Mountains. His organization is about being out in nature but is primarily about practicing mediation.

I have been looking forward to this retreat for quite some time. When I first heard about it, I was very excited and hoped I could attent. AS the event got closer, I realized that I haven't been camping in a long time, probably over 10 years. I thought about backing out and even looked for other plans I could possible schedule for the same weekend. But I knew I wanted to go and that the activities were all things I would like to do. Plus, I really liked Aadesh and knew that I would like to support him and spend more time with him. So here I am.

I borrowed Caroline's camping gear. She gave me her hammock and all the necessary accessories to make for a good backpacking experience in the mountains.

One of the attendees, Joe, is someone I know from Aadesh's friend group. He picked me up in the morning from Caroline's apartment. Unfortunately, we were running late because we had misunderstood what time we were supposed to meet up. Not to mention Caroline and I were enjoying some morning snuggles with our dog that got me out of bed a little later than I had planned for even the late time to meet ðŸ™ƒ

Caroline is so great though. She got up and started packing for me when I told her I was running later. She got me out the door much more quickly that I would have been ready.

We hiked to White Pine Lake. It was about 5 miles from the trailhead. Aadesh had prepared a Deep Earth meditation. That means that for 4.8 miles, Aadesh would stop us at intervals of the hike and tell us about events that occurred during the 4.8 billion history of the Earth. It was a very cool meditation that led to some very interesting conversation on the way up the mountain. 

I really like Aadesh's approach to meditation. He led a discussion on meditation at the Sleepy Boys Club a couple months ago. He believes that meditation is what happens when you are present in any activity, not just sitting cross-legged on the floor with your eyes closed. That seems to be a central aspect of his Meditation in the Mountains organization. That there are many ways to practice meditation and many activities that one can enjoy in a very present way.

On the way p the mountain, I asked everyone what they would do with $100M.

Joe said he would buy a ranch in Montana and then invest the rest of the money in research about helping people escape poverty. 

Jake said he would but a large modern country home probably in Utah or Colorado and then invest the rest in some sort of social issue. He liked Joe's idea about poverty, but also thought about something in healthcare, specifically nutrition. 

I said that I would buy a $25M investment portfolio that paid in annual dividens. I would incorporate that asset into a nonprofit towards something I care about. I used to think that I would like to fund college scholarships. I would hire someone I trusted that was interested in the nonprofit and have them pay themself out of the dividens and use the rest to fund as many scholarships as possible. I would then incorporate another identical fund for myslef as a source of perpetual income. I would like use $10-15M to fund the dreams of the people in my life. For example, I would buy my parent's home and probably give them the rest of $1M. I have a friend who has a dream of writing a book series. I could give them $1M and they would be able to quit their job and start writing. Then I would incorporate the remaining $35M and buy a large plot of land somwhere in the Northwest and start a commune with my closest friends. It would be a formal institution and there would be contracts for living on the commune. The commune would be oriented towards self-sufficiency and sustainability, but I wouldn't expect that everyone worked on the same things or had the same contributions to the commune. I would expect that some would still want to have a job or career, some may be interested in artistic endeavors, and some may be very interested in the sustainability of the commune. Ideally, the commune would have a few sources of income, and all would contribute in the ways that were necessary to the wellbeing of the group.

Aadesh said he would use all the money to start monasteries. They would be oriented towards establishing peace between ideologies and religions. He would establish these monasteries at the base of mountains and each monastery could self-direct in it's mission and doctrines. It is precesely the kind of thing he is doing now with meditation in the mountains. I'm really happy for him that he is already living his dream, even if in a smaller way that he would if he had $100M.
