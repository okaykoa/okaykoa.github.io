I don't know how many days I've missed at this point, and it makes me sad to think about it. 

I started this blog for a few reasons that ran together to lead to what I chose to do:

1. I wanted to write more.

I want to be a writer. I want my life's work to take the form of writing. Whenever people ask me what I want to do or what I would do if money weren't an object, my answer is always that I would want to write. I have some ideas of what I would want to write, but idk if I have the voice and talent for writing those things yet. Instead, I need practice writing. I need time to develop as a writer. So, I needed a place where I could start the practice of writing--ideally, as a daily practice. But I also needed _stuff_ to write about. So the daily practice of journaling was the best solution to moving forward with the practice of writing.

2. I wanted to journal.

I have wanted to track my life for a long time, but I haven't had the impetus to do so. Now that I had some additional reasons (this one is listed pretty highly, but almost all the reasons for starting this project contributed to this reason being fulfilled) to start writing and that meant I needed content, journaling was a no-brainer. It's fun to be able to look back at my life, see what I was thinking, see what I was feeling, and see how what I experienced in the moment differs from the way I view events in hind-sight. I also want to be able to look back at my life and remember what it was like to experience different phases and chapters. So far in my journaling experience, I have mostly been in a single, awesome, positive chapter of my life. And I'm really glad to be able to document that chapter. Likewise, I hope to be able to look back at more difficult chapters of my life and see the value in them and appreciate the narrative that wa forming around those events in real time. So having missed a couple days is pretty sad to me. Those are days, events, feelings, and experiences that are simply lost to time. Not that I couldn't document those things in hind-sight, but the moment of those experiences is gone. Anything I do now will be through the lens of time. Not a good reason not to try to document things, but a good reason to morn them, I think. 

3. I wanted to track my mood.

Each of my entries has a title that starts with a mood. I try to keep the mood as one single word, but it hasn't always been possible to find a word that truly captured the way I was feeling that day. I've tried tracking my mood before with different apps, but I've struggled to use those apps, particularly to develop the habit of tracking my mood daily. There was too much variability in where my mood might be during the day, and the apps weren't adaptable enough to account for that. And given that the update on that app was so simple, it became difficult to accept the decisions I made around my mood tracking since they could be changed so easily as well. This practice however, is a lot more rigorous. Once I've made a decision, it's hard to go about wanting to change it much, since I've already written a few hundred words, thought about them, created a single title to summarize my entry, and _then_ think about my mood _and_ convert that feeling into a single word. I just don't have enough energy to overthink my mood. In the case that I struggle too much to complete the mood tracking task perfectly, I have to settle for the best I can do. Luckily, settling has truly and honestly meant documenting my mood as "happy" as of late üôÇ.

4. I wanted to build a website from scratch-ish.

The last thing I want to articulate is that I really wanted to try building a website the hard way. This is indeed one of the hard ways to do it. This one also happens to be free and within the skillset that I have developed over the past few years. This ended up being super helpful as I built another website that's very similar to this one for a different purpose and it's worked very well. I'm not totally happy with the way the website looks today, but with time, I'm sure I will develop more web development skills and be able to make this website look really good üôÇ. For now, this is definitely good enough and meets the purpose, goals, and challenge I was looking for.

I want to write about so much more, but Caroline and I are about to go out and have a great day date so I just don't have time. Sorry ‚òπÔ∏è
