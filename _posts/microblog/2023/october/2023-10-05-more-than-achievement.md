I am again sad that I missed writing yesterday. There is a sort of paradoxical thing about my time. As I spend more time doing things that are worth recording and writing about, I have less time and energy to dedicate to writing about them. 

I have really been making the most of my time. So much tho that I'm sad as I watch the time fly by and I say goodbye to all the possibilities that might have been. The opportunities and dreams that I could have accomplished if I had spent the time on that instead of the things I have been spending my time on. And I have been thoroughly enjoying the things that I have been doing! I find that there is just not enough time in a life. 

Of course, there are people who accomplish a lot in life. And I'm sure they accomplish it because they use their time to achieve those things they ideate and dream of. But, and I mean this genuinely, what if I don't seek to achieve as the main purpose of my life? What if I don't care that I leave the legacy of a Wikipedia page with my first and last name as the title? I think there are many ways to skin the cat that is life, and all of them are equally as valid. Should I feel guilty for not having realized every idea and dream I could think of? I don't think so, even though I do often feel the guilt of not having realized them.

Yesterday Caroline and I were supposed to go to a concert that I was really looking forward to. But we were both exhausted. A couple days ago, I broke the device I use for preventing my snoring. Yeah, I'm a pretty bad snorer... and I hate it. So the night before last, I didn't have that anti-snore device and that meant that I spent much of the night, in fact, snoring. This kept her up and in turn resulted in me getting jostled awake several times... I deserved it, but it meant that neither of use slept very well. 

So yesterday we skipped that concert. But we still had a great night! We watched some shows, ate some food, and just enjoyed eachother's company. We've spent a lot of the last week apart and otherwise very busy. I'm really glad I have a partner who really enjoys taking time to just spend together. This is exactly what I mean when I say that I want something other than achievement out of life. 

I don't think I wrote the other day about having lunch with my HS best friend's parents in SLC. It was really nice to catch back up with them and see them living their very best golden years. We're actually having dinner together tomorrow night at my favorite restaurant and Caroline will be able to be there. I'm really looking forward to that :)

Oh, and tonight Caroline is joinging me at a company party. I'm very much looking forward to her meeting my work friends and coworkers :)
