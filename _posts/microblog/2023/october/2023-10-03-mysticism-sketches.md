I'm actually shocked that I didn't write something yesterday. It was such a good day.

I feel like I should have written something in the morning... I genuinely can't remember why I didn't... I think I was working on a few things with the club I'm doing. I also kind of got right into work after our walk with our dog. I guess it makes sense, but I just did so much yesterday that I actually thought I wrote an entry for yesterday.

I've been participating in an art challenge that a local art collective is doing. The collective is called the Arch Hive. They are a Mormon cult mysticism art group in Provo. They do a lot of stuff that I've been a fan of, including the Refill Lake Bonneville movement, which is an ironic environmental movement. 

The challenge they are doing is simply a daily prompt for creating art. I've been sketching every day by the prompt that they provide. I've been having a lot of fun and I'm really looking forward to being able to look back at all the sketches I did :). The one thing I'm not big on about the challenge is that it is very Mormon oriented. I mean, obviously it is, but for the most part you can wiggle around that aspect of the primpts. However, there are a couple of prompts that are particularly Mormon and you can't really avoid it. For those days, I think I will probably end up approaching the task in a fairly cheeky way, either wilfully misinterpreting the prompt or maybe drawing something a little absurd. Not to be disrespectful, but as a means of separating myself personally from the Mormon aspect while still engaging sincerely in a community that is close to me geographically, but also in other meaningful ways that should be celebrated. 

I've been having a lot of fun with that club that I've been designing. Yesterday we had an activity that went really well. It was nice to have people participating thoughtfully in activities around philosophy. The people, the conversation, the intention, and the result were all great. I'm really looking forward to seeing how the club grows and molds into something special for everyone involved. 

I'm super busy today. I'm at the office for just a couple hours and then I will head up to SLC. I have a backpack with clothes and my work backpack but I don't have my car so I'm doing a frontpack/backpack set up as I ride up to the city. It's going to be a great week I think :)
