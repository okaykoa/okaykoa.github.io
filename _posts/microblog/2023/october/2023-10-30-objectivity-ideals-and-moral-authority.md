I am so imperfect. That sounds reminiscent of another time in my life, and time when I was a religious person who believed in the concept of sin and the ways in which is distanced me from this concept of "perfection" that mostly just meant blameless. When I say perfect now, I don't mean free from sin. 

I was once at an unorthodox Jewish wedding. Rabbi Emily said, "Only artifice is truly perfect." I have understood that and thought about it often since that day. Perfection is only a measure of alignment with a subjective ideal. There is no objective meaning to the word perfection, only a goal that one must hold and then compare the reality to it. It's very platonic, and I fucking hate Plato.

When I say that I am imperfect, I mean that I have a great number of beliefs and ideals. I think that they are mostly correct and valuable. I have thoughts about the way one should live their life and rules by which one can achieve them. And I often am so misaligned with my ideals. The way that I am and the way that I behave is often out of harmony with the way I would like to be. It is that discordance with my ideals that makes me say that I am imperfect.

Carl Rogers would have said that my real self is not congruent with my ideal self. This is what I mean by imperfect, though imperfect has a sort of moralizing connotation to it. The term perfect does seem to have a strong connection to a sense of objectivity. 

Subjective things can attain a sense of objectivity once the subjective goal about such things has been selected. For example, the game of chess has several known gamified positions. One, playing the game of chess, knows which moves are objectively better when in a gamified position--if you make certain moves, you are guaranteed to win. However, one must have agreed to play the game of chess in order for these moves to be objectively better. If one does not care to accomplish the goal--to win--then they are not playing the game of chess. And there is no objectively good reason for playing the game of chess. Therefore, it must be the goal that defines a small set of objectivity, but that goal cannot be objective itself.

So why am I imperfect? There is a subjective set of rules upon which I have decided to live my life. Those rules are and have always been flexible--to my benefit or detriment. That's the problem. Those rules are subjective. I don't know if those rules are truly the best foundation upon which to establish my life. But for whatever reason, I have decided to base my life upon them and measure my "perfection" on that alignment. 

I don't think that it's so much the rules that matter to me. I acknowledge that the rules are subjective and, therefore, subject to change as compelling reason for the change is discovered. But, there is a virtue that measures one's resolve to their own ideals: integrity. I think perhaps this is the virtue that I am measuring when I use the words perfect and imperfect. It doesn't matter what rules for living I have selected, and it doesn't matter that they are subjective and will likely change over time. But, in the moment when I believed in the rule, when I thought it was the moral and/or ethic way to live a life, did I adhere to it? Did I have the moral authority required to state that ideal? Did I avoid hypocrisy and all sorts of self-justification? Was I a person of moral character?

I suppose I'm seeking a sort of moral authority through integrity. No one owes moral authority to the world, but it seems to be something that is important to me.
