On Wednesday night, Caroline and I headed out from Utah down toward AZ to visit her parents. On Wednesday night we made it to La Verkin, a town outside of Zion National Park. We stayed there so that we could go to Caroline's favorite coffee shop, Red Rock Coffee Roasters. It was a lovely little coffee shop; it was very busy. The shop is right on a cliff over a creek that runs through the area with the rock formations that make the whole area around Zion as iconically pretty as it is. 

We made our way out of Utah and into AZ through Colorado City. I guess Colorado City is kind of a weird town, but going through AZ fromt there was very pretty. Tons of red rocks and formations for miles. Then we arrived at Flagstaff and drove south to drive through the Oak Creek Canyon. That was Beautiful! Then we drove through Sedona, and I know a place that needs to be added to my future travel list.

It was only a few more hours to get to Caroline's parent's place in Phoenix. We are looking forward to enjoying a long weekend with her family and 5 pugs ðŸ˜…. We brought McGee and Caroline's parents have 4 pugs of their own. It was certainly a wild night list night with 5 pugs who were all excited about visitors and visiting.

Oh, and a group of pugs is called a grumble.
