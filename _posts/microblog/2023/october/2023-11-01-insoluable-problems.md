Sometimes it feels like life keeps coming and it doesn't stop. Of course, this is always the case, but there are times when life does feel like it stops or moves more slowly. 

I would like to have life move a bit more slowly, but I would also like to do a lot with my life. It seems to be a bit of an insoluable problem. 

I do really like my life and definitely think there are fewer lives that I would trade mine for than those that I wouldn't trade for. But there is also the problem of the disatisfaction that comes with the daily grind of life. Is there any life where these problems are mitigated? It seems like there would be, but so many people in situations I would trade for seem to still be struggling with this or another problem in their life too. What can one do?

I wonder how someone really comes to accept and appreciate all that they have in life. I wish I could find more satisfaction with my life without the need to reach out into the future to find what I am looking for. There are probably very accessible means to enjoying life more fully. Maybe I should do a little research and try one of them.
