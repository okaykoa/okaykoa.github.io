I don't even know where to start; there is so much to write. Never enough time to write it all. 

I think there was a book where there was a writer, just writing all day. They were writing everything that was happening in the book... this may have been The Neverending Story, but I've never read it so idk fs lol.

That's how I feel in this moment. There is so much to write and I just will never have enough time to write it all.

I had a thought the other day that I would like to write about sleep. I have learned a few things over the years, mostly that we don't get enough sleep. And also that we don't have a realistic view on what sleep should look like. 8 hours a night is a general rule, but the variations are many and the margin of error may be in the magnitude of hours. Emphasis on the plurality.

I don't think I'll have enough time to write much today, but having written should be enough to settle my mind at least. 

I'm a little bit distracted. I'm writting this after midnight (technically the morning of the 29th) and feeling very rushed. 

I'm pretty frustrated with some of the realities of life. I wish I could just take several months at a time to work on important personal goals. Maybe a couple months to focus on my physical health. Not just thinking about weight loss, but being able to take care of my body--ollow up with a medical professional regarding some of the aches and pains and concerns that have come up for me as I've gone into my thirties. I'd love to take some time to write, to work on creative and inventive projects that I just don't have the time to do. I'd also like to be able to dedicate time to education. Both topics of interest and professional development. Oh that I had a year's salary alread in the bank and could take a year off to find myself. I suppose I'm feeling a little bitter tonight that I wasn't born to a wealthy family or that my parents weren't willing to coddle me to the point of ignorance. This view is of course full of contempt, and I dislike that for myself. Not only is it unfair to hold a sense of blame towards those who were born "more fortunate" than me, but it is also arrogance on my end to believe that I could even begin to assess what it means to be "more fortunate." How could I possibly know the life of another person just because they had the resources to custom build a sprinter van? Sure, I could make some likely accurate assumptions from the correlations between something like a custom sprinter van and class or priveledge, but those "likely accurate" assumptions are based on statistical data, which is highly effective for describing a set of outcomes but is not reliable for individuals. Whose to say that any person I am judging through a gritted smile wouldn't trade it all for the very same things I have in my life. Even if I don't have a house paid off, I'm fortunate enough to have a mortgage (god did I just type that?), which is more than a lot of people my age can say. I have a partner who is absolutely wonderful and is in love with me. Even for people who have been in partnerships, even marriages, for many years, feeling like your partner is in love with you seems to be a rare and treasured thing. 

So, I'm feeling bad for myself, wishing that my circumstances were different. But I'm trying to figure out how to live with the reality that life kind of sucks most of the time and enjoy the most out of the little things that matter to me and make life worth living. 

Goodnight, Neverland.
