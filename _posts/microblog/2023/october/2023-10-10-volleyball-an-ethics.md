Yesterday was a really fun day. I didn't sleep well the night before, but I went on a long walk in the morning because I had to take my car to the shop. Then, when I got back, Caroline was still sleeping, so I took McGee out on his morning walk. It was a lovely start to the morning. 

Once Caroline got up, I ordered some kolaches for breakfast and we talked while we ate some food. Eventually, the day got going and I had to go to the office to get some work done. 

I had a really busy end to the day. I went to Marissa's books to meet with a new friend, Joseph. He is one of the folks that went on that meditation retreat. He's a very smart, well-read dude who is studying economics at the University of Utah. We played a couple games of chess and then he told me a little bit about an ethical framework called Care Ethics. I would really like to know more about Care Ethics, but so far, all I know is that Care Ethics takes into account the feminine perspective on ethics and morality. The majority of ethical frameworks are designed and implemented according to the problem-sovling frameworks that make sense to men. The problem here is that women don't necessarily view the world the same way that men do. In fact, they can see if so differently and use such different means of making sense of it, that the current models of ethics sometimes don't make sense or can even disparage women. An ethical framework that ostracizes 50% of the population fromt he get-go probably isn't a very useful framework for ethical behavior. So far, I don't know much about how Care Ethics is more conducive to female participation, but I would like to understand it a bit more. 

Joseph said that he has a small group of friends that like to get together to discuss philosophy. He invited me to join the next dicussion, which should be on Care Ethics. And he decided he liked Marissa's Books so much that he would like to have the philosophy discussion at that location :)

Then to end the night, I had my last league volleyball game. It turns out that our team was placed in the lowest possible division in the league, which meant that our single victory by way of forfeit was enough to qualify us for the championship tournament lol. What was even more surprising was just how much better at volleyball our team has gotten. A few weeks ago I tried encouraging the team to actually work on playing volleyball the way it was meant to be played. And it took us until the third of three games to actually start to get it and have success. Last night, it only took a few volley's for us to start to get in the groove and then we kept that groove going for the whole night! We won our first match yesterday and then we played again in the championship game and played really well! We lost a game, won a game, and then lost a game to end the season. But it was probably the next night of volleyball of the league.
