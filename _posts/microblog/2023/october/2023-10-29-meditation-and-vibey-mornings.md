Whatever will I write today...

Today my brain feels a little more empty than it does most days. Most days I feel like I wake up with a lot to think about and a lot to do. I don't think that today is much different from most days, but I think this morning has gotten off to an intentionally slow start. Last night, Caroline told me she wanted to let today be an intentionally good day. We use the word "vibey" for days like this. Mornings that start at their own pace, rather than the pace of the world. Days that start slow, almost as if we were arising from a savasana, gentle and easy. Days that start with a breakfast that the body requests, rather than one we force down the gullet on the way to work. Days that start by appreciating the morning weather, the slow rise of the sun, and the slow rise of ourselves. 

So far, the day has been rather "vibey." Yet, we have still been productive. I think the intentionality of seeking a vibey morning has allowed me to relax my brain from the things that would usually jump start my day into immediate productivity, the escape from falling behind. 

It feels really nice to be in this place. I suppose this is what mindfulness feels like, right? That moment of being present without distaction? A sense of being right where you are instead of feeling like you're in another place or another time, your mind truly on the task at hand, your emotions filtering the inputs of your body as they are rather than the inputs of future, past, or imagined fears. 

I feel like, and I could be absolutely wrong, meditation is the practice of honing in on a single signal. I've thought of it before as listening to the radio. My father listens to AM radio (god forbid), which has always seemed to me to be a lower-quality signal than FM. I have also noticed the analogy appear in the spectrum between the left and right side of the dial on FM only radios. Let AM radio and the left side of the dial be analogous and FM radio and the right side of the dial be as well.

When one is on the left side of the dial, there is often some mixing of signals. This means that as you are listening to a certain frequency, the sound of the programming you are listening too may include some sounds from other programs as well. These other programs are from other frequencies, but something about the quality of the signal you are listening to, the aparatus you are using to listen to it, or perhaps your movement in a car passing under a bridge along the interstate cause the signals to get mixed up, making it difficult for you to enjoy or possibly even hear the signal you are trying to listen to. 

The right side of the dial, on the other hand, is a much higher quality signal. I think there is some scientific reasoning behind why the 107's are so much clearer than the 89's. But that signal is so much more clear that there are rarely any interruptions or crossed signals, and the quality of the audio is usually much better as well. 

I think this is a good analogy for what meditation is. Many people think of meditation as being the act of making one's mind truly blank, truly having no thought. And I think this is true in some semantic sense that I don't really care to try to explain in this moment. But, an alternate view of meditation that I have is the act of active meditation. Some people call it flow, mindfulness, being present, etc. But it's when we are truly engaged in something. When we are having so much fun, thinking so clearly, purely experiencing, that there are no extracurricular signals playing on our radio. We are listening to nothing but a high quality signal without interruption. 

I think that is what meditation is. That's what I think mindfulness and prescence are. And I think that's what makes for a vibey morning :)
