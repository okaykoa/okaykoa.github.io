Last night I had a three-hour-long conversation with a friend. And when the conversation was over, I apologized that I was cutting the conversation short. 

I love having friends like that. People who connect deeply, who talk about how they really feel, and who are confident and humble about how they approach their opinions and the way they think. 

This friend lives in Austin and I miss him a lot. I met him through his wife, who was a long-time internet friend. I miss them both, and their kids are awesome.

We talked about so many things, one of the first of which was the club I started. He thought that was so cool, and he would be an obvious founder if he still lived around here. We talked about the Barbie movie and the philosophical implications of the film. I found that conversation to be one of the more productive conversations I've been able to have about the movie, which is just a little sad to me since it was a conversation between two men about a movie that is so obviously about feminism. At one point, I was having a real brain blast moment about something he said, then he went on to say, but you should ask Kate about it (his wife). That was a really cool moment for me. 

The thing is, when it comes to conversations about women and feminism, it's so blatantly obvious that women should be not just included but made central to the conversation. It feels so wrong to say "made central" as if it is the man's responsibility to construct a situation where a women is placed (as if an object) in the middle of any conversation about women or feminism. And this is so obvious, yet it still doesn't happen enough. But, the critique of "you should listen to a woman" has been, in my experience, a very unhelpful one. That critique, especially in internet spaces, has been used as a mic drop line to end a conversation. Those who I've seen use it, have typically followed that critique with another common sentiment: "I am done educating men." 

Both of these statements, clich√©s, opinions, sentiments (whatever they are) are totally justified and valid. The first, a fact. Men should listen to women. Period. But especially on topics about them. And women are tired of having to scream their experience at men only for men to fail to understand, fail to put in the effort, or outright troll women just for the fun of it. It is truly exhausting to be a woman and constantly have to justify your existence in a world that is build by and for men. This is so obvious.

So knowing this experience. understanding that women live in this hopelessly impossible situation, how do I as a man becoming educated on the female experience? What steps can I take to listen to, understand, and better support women? On the one hand, it's tantamount that I listen to women. That I hear them and really connect with a woman about her experience. I believe this wholeheartedly. On the other hand, women are so tired of having to share their experience, of feeling like the ambassador of women to men, of having to speak carefully about their experience in a way that reflects the experience of women generally. And due to this incredible pressure, many women are done talking altogether. 

I know this task is not impossible, however, I think the contradiction between these two very real, very valid, and very common sentiments is clear. All that I mean to say is not that these aren't valid criticisms, sentiments, or opinions, but that when they are used, well-intentioned men often feel downstream without a paddle and very, very foolish. 

So, when Robbie said "you should talk to Kate about this," I truly appreciated his suggestion. The difference between his suggestion and the common criticism "you should talk to a woman" is that Robbie wasn't trying to make me feel foolish for wanting to know more and lacking awareness or understanding. His purpose wansn't to point out the flaws in my approach to learning or tone police the way I was going about my growth (all of which are valid ways to address a man, I should add). But Robbie gave me that same critique ("You should talk to a woman") in a way that was actaully actionable. He said, "Not only should you talk to a woman, here is a woman who is knowledgable and willing to share her experience with you." That was so helpful to me as a man who genuinely wants to improve the way he thinks about and interacts with topics in feminsim. 

In short, the critiques are valid. Not adjustments needed. The only note I have is that providing something, anything actionable that a man can do will do so much more to improve the state of affairs. Not just men, but any person who feels like they have an actionable step in front of them will be far more inclined to do it and feel comfortable with take the next step out of their comfort zone.

After the Barbie movie we went on to talk about much more, from anarchy to spirituality to community to argumentation. There was just so much to talk about and I wish I could have these kinds of interactions on a far more regular basis.
