There was something I thought about yesterday that I really wanted to write about. But I cant remember what it was. 

This might be the first time that I don't really feel like writing. I think it might be because I have a lot of things on my mind that I would like to have figured out, and those things are not writing my daily journal entry. But, I can say that I'm happy that I'm getting my journal entry out of the way. If I wasn't already writing here, it probably wouldn't get done today. 

There are a lot of things for me to be grateful for in my life. Among the most valuable is the fact that the things that occupy my mind the most tend to be the things that I want occupying my mind. I think about writing, ethics and morality, social issues, art, my own personal wellbeing. There are far less fulfilling things to have on my mind, like work. 

Dude, I hate work so much. Like, I don't hate my job, I have a great job. But I hate the idea that the majority of my time has to be spent working on someone else's dream. That my efforts go to making someone else rich while I constantly feel like I'm choosing between whether I'd rather spend time on making myself a better employee or enjoying my life. Should I take time off today to deal with my mental health, relax, get some chores done, or should I clock in like a good little wage earner and make daddy some better margins for the board? Yuck.

I don't think I want to end on that note, but also, that's a pretty strong opinion I have. I think I'll just leave it there.
