Today I am feeling good. My back has been hurting for about a week. I rode my motorcycle to Caroline's apartment earlier this week. She has been borrowing my car (for several weeks now actually) because her car has been in the shop to get some work done. So she has had my car and I live 40 minutes away ðŸ™ƒ. I have taken the train, ridden my motorcycle, and dropped her off at work and picked her up for a few weeks now. 

So the other day when I was on my way up to her apartment (which was going to be super convenient as I had a conference this week in SLC), I carried two bags on my back at the same time. I had a bag with clothes for the conference and my work backpack with two laptops in it (one for work and one for personal use). Anyway, I don't know quite when it happened, but I must have hurt my back during that ride because that night my back got really tight and the next morning I felt like I had thrown out my back. So the lesson I learned is that when riding a motorcycle at 70MPH down the interstate, it's probably best not to overload your back for that ride...

But today I'm feeling really good. I got to sleep in quite a bit. Caroline took McGee out on his walk and I continued to sleep in a bit. She made me breakfast and coffee and now we are looking at a nice productive but also fun day together before she goes in to work. 

I love that I have so much going on in my life. So many opportunities. I wonder if I will have enough time to enjoy and make the most of them all... probably not. I'm still thinking about time as I wrote about it yesterday. There are just so many opportunities for me and ideas that I have. I wish I had more time to engage in those things but there are necessary evils in my life that give me a really comfortable and enjoyable one. There is a sort of paradoxical nature to life, at least the way that many experience it today.

My boss told me the other day about some writings by Seneca. That Seneca believed that no person was stuck in life. All people can make a decision to change their circumstances. I definitely agree with this in part, though one cannot control everything about their life and some external forces have an imprending influence over our options. But I do think that people have more control over their own decisions than they give themselves credit for. It's just that sometimes autonomy is a serious problem to be considered. What if I really enjoy the comforts that a nine-to-five job create for my life? What if I like having a spare bedroom and room for unnecessary storage? These are things that, in the society I participate in, require resources to make happen. Resources that my current career and social status give me. If I make a radical decision, I may loose some of those comforts...
