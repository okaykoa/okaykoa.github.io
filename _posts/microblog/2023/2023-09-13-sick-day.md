I got sick today. It made for a not very fun day at all. Fortunately, I had some medicine from the last time I was sick a few months ago. Without it, today would have been a pretty miserable day.

It was really hard to think today. I still had to work bc there are somethings that have to happen on Wednesdays that I just can't skip. But being able to work from home is a luxury I'm lucky to have available to me. 

Even though today was a pretty rough day being sick, I still feel very forunate for my life. This is a very minor flaw in the grand scheme of many, many things that are going very well for me. I'm very grateful for my life. I hope that I am making enough of my life.
