Tonight I listened to the audiobook, "Leadership and Self-deception: Getting Out of the Box."

I had read the book before in college; not because it was assigned but because I had taken an interest in the idea of self-deception and noticed the book on a mentor's desk. That first read-through--now half a decade ago--ended up being one of the more important formative moments of my life.

This second read-through (completed in only a matter of hours thanks to 2x speed audiobooks) was inspired by my recent first read-through of the Anatomy of Peace and was similarly an experience of great impact.

Though I experienced several lasting changes from reading Leadership and Self-deception, this read-through reminded me of several habits and mindsets that I hold, which inhibit me from being the person I want to be and seeing people the way I would like to see them.

Many of the books I have read lately were chosen for the purpose of being a better communicator and partner in my yet blossoming relationship. Though we have hit stride in many ways, there are still ways in which I would like to see myself improve as a partner, communication not being the least of them.

As I have read books about communication, relationships, and conflict resolution, I have  noticed a common warning against applying the methods from the books to identify faults in others. As this warning came up tonight, I had a moment of self-reflection:

> Have I fallen into the trap of looking for flaws in my partner as I read books to supposedly improve myself?

The conclusion I came to is that I probably have tried to identify my partner's problems as I've read these books. But, more importantly, what I realized is that I truly haven't found any grave faults in my partner as I've read about the major pitfalls in relationships and communication. On the contrary, I have realized just how lucky I am to have a partner who, though not perfect, exhibits a great deal of engagement, honestly, humility, accountability, and acceptance in our relationship.

I have read about critical issues in effective communication and seen where I struggle with being honest and open. But in my efforts to employ what I have been learning, my partner has only shown me patience and acceptance of my needs and feelings.


I couldn't possibly feel more grateful for her or more lucky to be with her.
