Since starting to write, yesterday was the first day I missed writing. That would have been September 5th and writing for September 4th. 

It's sad bc I have genuinely had so much to write about every day. I didn't expect to write so much or to have so much to say, but my life is so fulfilling these days. I feel like I don't have nearly enough time to write what is important to me. I guess that's been the case for some time as my dream job would be to be a writer. I have had several things I have wanted to write but I simply haven't been able to find the time in my life to write them. 

I have been very lucky in my life to have found a career that allows me to feel very accomplished, that pays well, and that allows me to seek many kinds of fulfillment in the time I have off of work. It's not perfect; I could image much better scenarios. But the truth is I have lived in far more worse secenarios than I can imagine better ones. 

Maybe one day I will be a writer, but for now I'm happy to be writing as much as I can. 

On the 4th, I had the day off for Labor Day. I spend the morning with my partner and it was really nice. We went for a nice long walk and had a nice long writing session. I wrote a bit more than usual, but I also could have written much longer.

After writing, we had some breakfast and then we decided to finish a puzzle we had started sometime last week. It had been on her counter since then, and my partner doesn't have a lot of space in her apartment. So it was really nice to just spend some time together, working on that task and chatting a little bit. 

Then I spent the rest of the day doing a lot of stuff. I had a workout with a friend; followed by therapy, which went super well; and then I drove down to Provo for a meetup with some friends. We are starting that club I think I've written about before. It's a club that I have started calling the Philosophy and Being Kind Club lol. We had a meeting that night and it was the most formal meeting we've had so far. We've been trying to formalize the club a bit more, creating a charter and planning our activities ahead. This meeting, though not perfect, was the most progress we've seen so far.

Then I went back to Caroline's place and waited for her to get off work. We had some pillow talk before bed. That was probably my favorite part of the day :)

Then, the next day (which should be today, but I'm writing this on Wednesday morning), got off to a pretty good start. We went on a walk and then I had to take off for a haircut. I really like my hair. I cut off about 10 inches and still have very long hair. Now it feels a lot more manageable than it was previously. I had some serious rocker hair. 

Work was a little tough yesterday. There are a lot of things moving for me and I hardly feel that I can keep up. I wish I had some different skills that would make my work a lot easier, and I'm trying to make a case for learning those skills. But I am not finding that I even have enough time to work on those skills... This isn't the first time I've felt like I have too much on my plate at work, but this is the most I've felt it fs.

I had another good workout last night and again waited for Caroline to get home from work before having some quality time with her before bed.

Yesterday, I wanted to talk to her about an insecurity I had been experiencing. I recently finished Bell Hooks' book, The Will to Change. In that book, I read about the ways that men are harmed by the patriarchy and the ways that said harm shows up in their lives. I don't think it would be fair to say that I fit the description of a patriarchal or misogynistic man, but there were parts of the book that definitely resonated with me. Things that I do, but even more so, things that I feel that seem to stem from the patriarchal education that I recieved as a boy. 

I talked about this insecurity with Caroline. Not necessarily asking for her help in overcoming it, not asking her to change anything to help me avoid experiencing it, I just wanted her to know that I had it. I had been working on not letting that insecurity affect my behavior and had actaully been successful in overcoming the insecurity altogether lately. But I had felt it come up and I wanted her to know that sometimes I won't be able to overcome it. That I might act out in a way that makes it obvious that something is wrong. I wanted her to know that the feeling is there and that I'm trying to overcome it. 

As always, she accepted me wholeheartedly. I feel so welcome in her life, heart, and arms. She is the best partner I have ever had.
