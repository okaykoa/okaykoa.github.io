Today was the first day back at work since last Wednesday. I had a nice break from responsibilities, which was good because my emotional bandwidth has been pretty much entirely consumed by this situation with my (ex) friend. It's too bad how it turned out, but I suppose I did all I could do to help that situation turn out positively. I don't think I handled it perfectly, but I certainly don't think I did anything wrong. In hindsight, there are a couple things I could have done differently that might have led to a different outcome, but that would be a case of expecting more from me when I got almost nothing from her. No accountability, no comments or engagement, really nothing at all. 

I supposed it's possible that I'm the one at fault here; that it's her that who wanted to end the relationship for my bad behavior. But none of her actions or comments would indicate that to be the case. Every complaint brough against me in August was erroneous (based on an interpretation of my intent, which was simply wrong) and rescinded at the time. My complaints remain as they are without withdrawl nor retort on her end. 

It's really strange to try to resolve conflict with someone so unwilling to take accountability. My mind wants to run through every situation where maybe I fucked up, where I have been unreasonable by leaving even one possibility in a hundered that I could have been misinterpreted, that I could have failed to be reasonable, that I didn't think of every way that she could have been offended. 

I genuinely feel remorse about this relationship--I put so much time and effort, I was so patient with misteps and accidents, I defended so much shitty behavior on her behalf to other people who thought she was a bad friend or even just a bad person. I just wish I hadn't given so much of myself to a person who would disregard every attempt I make at resolution and find every opportunity to interpret intentional harm when the absolute opposite was intended. It's just strange to have a relationship with someone like that and to watch it end. I am doing everything I can to help a person, to apologize for my misteps, and to make things right and they just insist on steering the boat straight into the iceberg.

There is a cruel part of me that looks forward to the day that our interactions come to light and people see her for what she is. That she will then want to make ammends. And I will have the opportunity to say "no, thank you." Idk if that's really cruel of me at this point, given the person she's been to me. She has been actually cruel. She has intended to harm me emotionally and mentally. I have called her out on it and she has not denied it. 

What do you do with a person like that?

I can hear my friends getting tired of me talk about this. "Just let it go," they say. 

I have struggled to let relationships go all my life. I still remember people, classmates from elementary school and middle school. This kid named Levi who shows up in my dreams sometimes, who I never was in class with but saw at my elementary school and a couple times during little league. This other kid, Chuck, from my sixth grade science class who I did have mor interactions with but never saw again after that year. I replied to an instagram story posted by this guy, Joe, that I knew in high school, though I never had much of a relationship with him. He was the barista at the school's cafe. He messaged back and seemed happy to hear from me. He told me a thing or two that he remembered about be and I did the same. 

The people I meet have always had a permanent spot in my mind. I would genuinely love to see any of them again--even the one's who haven't been the kindest to me. 

I will miss the relationship I had with this friend. It was a real, deep, and meaningful relationship I had with them. At least it felt like it to me. I gave my best effort in trying to resolve the situation with them, but something about what I was able to do was not enough. Perhaps nothing would have been enough (there go my friends again). 

I suppose there's nothing more to say. It's time to let it go.
