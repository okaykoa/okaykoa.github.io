The first part of today was a really good day. Caroline and I did some Christmas decorating and then we cuddled and watched TV.

But the last half of the day was pretty stressful for me. There were lots of people in the apartment complex, which made McGee anxious and he kept barking really loudly at people who were being loud in the halls. His barking startled me several times and made me feel anxious for much of the night. 

That friend who I had a faling out with a couple months ago asked me the other day if we could hang out next week. I felt like I didn't really have any option but to accept but I've been really stressed about that as being around her makes me feel uncomfortable, unsafe, and fearful. So I spent some time writing a letter than I think I will probably give to her the night that we meet. I have no idea how it will go, but I think I am prepared for whatever maay happen.
