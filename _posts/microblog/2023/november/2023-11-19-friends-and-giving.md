This is a post I'm writing the day after the labeled date, but I want to account for my mood for that day. I will write again tonight.

Today was a pretty rough day. There was a bit of a miscommunication between Caroline and me. But at the end of the day we sat down to resolve the issue and that conversation was tough, but it ended very well. I really love my relationship with her. 

This week will be a fast one. But I am looking forward to a couple things this week, including Thanksgiving with Caroline, a couple days off, and a friendsgiving I was invited to.

Unfortunately, I had to start a conversation with that friend. And the friendsgiving is at her house. I'm hoping that conversation will go well, but I'm not totally confident that it will be resolved by the date fo the friendsgiving.
