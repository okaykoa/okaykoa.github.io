There are so not enough hours in a day. It's almost 1 am on the 16th and I'm still trying to get things off of my brain in into a documents somewhere. I'm exhausted and wish I knew what the hell I'm doing and if it's the right place to be putting my effort. I have no clue.

Today I worked from Caroline's place. That was nice. And she was on a day shift all day, which meant I had plenty of good hours of focused work. Yet, I feel that I have so much left to do...

This evening we met her grandparents for dinner. We went to a very nice steakhouse in SLC, the Capital Grille. I ate too much, and it was very nice food. 

I wish I had more to give in today's entry, but I'm honestly so mentally exhausted. I feel that I haven't been able to do as much writing as I would have liked this month. I was hoping to take advantage of NaNoWriMo as an inspiring opportunity to put the pedal to the metal. I felt like it was still the beginning of the month, but I'm writing this post in the technically the last half of the month. I guess I will have to do my best with what is left of my time, which is really true in every situation when one might say it. 

I'm hoping to get a couple of specific things done this month, so maybe you can hope and pray with me that it might get done.
