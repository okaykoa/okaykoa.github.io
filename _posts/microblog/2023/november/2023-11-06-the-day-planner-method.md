Today was yet another very fast day, leaving me feeling incomplete, rushed, behind, and underproductive. 

I have been carrying thoughts in my head all day bc I haven't had a good opportunity to write them down. I think I need to develop an easier way to write down the thoughts in my head. By this I mean an app that is easily accessible on both my computer (where I am a more proficient writer) and on my phone (where I am far les efficient, but where I have a high level of accessibility at all times--except driving). 

I find that my mind is filled with ideas often throughout the day. Having these ideas come to mind and then feeling like I have to juggle them around until I can write them down causes me some stress. I think the company Day Planner used to create training materials for their products. In one of those training materials, Day Planner recommended keeping your planner by your bedside so that if you had a thought while in bed, either before going to sleep or sometime during the night, you could roll over, jot it down, and it would be there when you were ready to get back to your day. There are a number of benefits that come from the accesibility of writing down your thoughts:

First, writing down your thoughts means that you wont forget them. Not because you will remember them just because you wrote them down. It is guaranteed that you will forget them from your mind. But that doesn't matter if you wrote them down in a place where you will review them, sort them, and then store them in another, long-term location for later use. 

Second, once you have removed a thought from you mind, you no longer have to juggle it mentally. Often, the responsibility of remembering things can feel like an anxious, stressful burden. But if you take a thought out of the mental juggling space, you can rest easy knowing that it is documented and will be there when you are ready to get back to it. 

Third, being able to write all your ideas down means that you will be more likely than the average person to actually follow through on your ideas. So many people have good ideas and never follow through on them. Their ideas are elusive for one or another or many reasons. But by taking the time to write your ideas down, you materialize them, even if just in one simple sense. Your ideas are more real that just that, and you now have a material object, a note, that you can save, study, manipulate, etc. And that means that your idea can be treated the same.

Finally (this list is not exhaustive), you will have documentation of your mind, your ideas, and what you do with your life. This may not be particularly valuable in the same way that realizing your ideas is; you probably wont be able to monetize or utilize the documentation of the fact that you have a life. But, you will be able to account for your life, which a large part of the world's population can't do. I think it's likely that most people live a life worth living, but very few people have the real evidence with which to justify that claim. I don't necessarily think that a person's life must be justified, but there are times when that proof may be valuable to yourself and maybe even others. There's no rule that you have to make use of such documenation or argue the value of your life, but when you document it, you at least have the option to do so, and I think that's a pretty cool power.
