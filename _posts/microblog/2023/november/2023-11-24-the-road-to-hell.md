Today was a tough day for me. It was a good day; but, emotionally, I found myself feeling really down. In the times when I planned to be productive, I found myself feeling incredibly lethargic, uninterested, and unable to focus. 

Caroline and I went to the batting cages mid day. That was actually a lot of fun. I had some good hits as I was warming up, mostly muscling through a lot of the swings. But, later in our activity, I realized that my hands were falling on a lot of my swings. I started to raise my hands in my load, like what felt like an exaggerated load, and I started really ripping into the ball. My launch angle increased from a generally down angle with some pop ups to level with the floor to the top pocket of the back of the cage. The ball was really jumping off my bat and in the right direction. It was really nice to see that change from just one minor adjustment. 

After going to the batting cages, I went home to try to be productive, but really I only found myself thinking about the situation with that friend. It feels like such a difficult situation for me because I have put so much effort into making that relationship work this year. I'm really sad that it feels like there was really nothing in my power to make that relationship work better. I took on much more than my share of the emotional effort and gave much more in that relationship while she took and took and then blamed me for things that often weren't even in my control or my fault. 

In this most recent conversation, I sent her a letter of a few things that had made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe to be around her. I asked for her acknoledgement, apology, and change to her behaviors, though I explicitly details several caveats such as my understanding that my perception of the behaviors is not guaranteed to be accurate, I am open to having these situations explained rather than apologized for, and I don't expect any changes to be perfect but do expect that adult conversation about them can occur. 

I just wanted her to be accountable for her behavior. 

Instead of acknoledging, apologizing, or explaining anything, she said she had no comment whatseover. When I went to open up the conversation further, she said it was an insult that I would write a letter like that and she wanted nothing to do with me moving forward. 

There is so much more to the situation. The things she had said and done, the things that I had communicated that I had wanted... I really had intended for this conversation to go much better, but she had made it clear in the past that she didn't want to fix things. So I approached it from that standpoint, explaining that I wanted to fix things, but I understood that it may be beyond her interest. Then she said multiple times that she was willing to put in the work to fix things. So I told her how I felt and what I needed. Then suddenly, it was no longer worth it, case closed. 

I don't know how people can be like this. I'm not saying that it's bad. I genuinely don't know how the do it. I certainly can't. I hold on to my realationships for far too long. I don't know how to let go, I don't know how to say goodbye, and I don't know how to set boundaries with people who treat me poorly. I'm too well-aware of the things that I do wrong to ever feel comfortable telling someone else that they've done wrong. And those things that I've done wrong, I've done them with every good intent. So when someone wrongs me, how am I supposed to accuse them in good faith, knowing that I do stupid shit all the time with the best intentions?

I feel like I'm constantly paving a beatifullly paved road. And the climate seems to be tropical and getting hotter.
