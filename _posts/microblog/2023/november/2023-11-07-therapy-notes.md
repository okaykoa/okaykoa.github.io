In therapy we did IFS today, and it was kinda woo woo. Talked to a little version of myself hiding behind a steel plate. He was keeping everyone away so that they couldn't hurt him.

After some work, he put down the plate and plopped down on a couch, exhausted.

Then we continued to do some work and I saw myself like a tiny little glass trinket in the hands of some deity. I was overcome with compassion for myself, the tiny little glass trinket, and understood how easy it would be to accidentally drop it or damage it. 

From this I understood that accidents can happen. People can hurt you on accident. But when someone hurts you on purpose or repeatedly damages you on accident (negligence) they are disregarding the immense value of a person.
