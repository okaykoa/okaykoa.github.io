The past few days have been up and down, pretty ambivalent. Moments of really happy times and moments of lots of stress and worry. I wish I had more time to write about it and document it, but I just don't. It's midnight on Thanksgiving and I really want to write about my day.

This morning Caroline and I hiked a short loop in Neff's Canyon. we didn't even finish it, but it was still a lovely way to start the morning. We of course brough McGee along on the dog-friendly trail and just loved on him all day today.

When we got home, Caroline made a really delicious Thanksgiving meal. We had chipotle chicken chile, chili cheese cornbread, and cherry cheese pie. It was all so good or should I say, ch- cherific? Idk, it's just a lot of "ch" words lol.

While she got started on preparing dinner, I called my mother and both sets of granparents. It was nice to talk to them as I hadn't talked to them so much in the past few months. I should definitely write about my communication with my grandparents sometime, but tonight is not that journal entry.

After dinner, we watched Elf, which has long been on our list (yes, we have a list--which is my fault). Then we snuggled and enjoyed each other's company for literally the rest of the night. It was such a great holiday that we got to spend together ü•∞

It snowed tonight too. I'm not sure if it was the first snow of the year, but it was our first snow walk with McGee this year and he loves the snow. It was really a magical day.

The only bad thing about the day is that the friend who I had that falling out and recovery conversation with earlier this year told me that she no longer wants to be friends or acquaintances. There is a long story there and I will probably try to write about that in the morning as it needs to be documented for myself. That was a difficult part of my morning, but in spite of that awful event, today was still one of the best days of the year, in a year that has been full of best days for me ‚ù§Ô∏è
