I woke up today witha tremendous pain in my left foot. A sharp pain along the outside edge of my foot, below the ankle that flares up with any movement but is also a constant throb that is quite distracting. I can't find a position that feels comfortable and advil and ice hasn't had much of an effect so far this morning. 

Caroline was very sweet to take the dog out on a walk without me as I can't really walk rn. When she got back, she prepared some breakfast and coffee for me. She is the perfect companion <3

The body functions are really interesting. How the body develops pain via inflamation for small injuries. The inflamation, carrying nutrients and healing to the affected area, while also inhibiting movement, which could potentially further exacerbate the problem and would also carry those healing nutrients away from the location with increased blood flow. Like, the body seems like a miracle, but when really studied and understood, the body simply obeys the laws of physics in a highly logical way, making use of the continuity of the properties of reality. There could be more efficient ways to heal the body, but these were the ones that developed in our bodies over millions and millions of years of evolution BECAUSE the proporties of physics were conducive to them. 

We are often inconvenienced by the body's functions. Itchiness, as a poignant example. We can become annoyed at these kinds of bodily functions present to us, but they were designed to keep up safe and healthy. And even though the pain of inflamation is super inconvenient, the inflamation itself is a miracle.
