There is seriously not enough time in a day. I feel like I got very little done today, though I had a full day in which I was able to accomplish a lot. I think there are probably lots of factors that contribute to the way the world is today: the high expectation of productivity, the transactional agreements we enter into that cause us to have to fulfill that productivity for livelihood, and the effects of those transactions and relationships on the personal lives of everyday people who negotiate their work with their life. I think there is a lot to be said about the reality of work life balance. 

I don't know if it would be possible to have a society that functions well without these transactions. In a world where people benefit from the work of those with strong convictions, do those who benefit have any reason to do the work themselves? And this isn't even an anti-progressive talking point I'm meaning to promote, less than half of qualified citizens in the US made time to vote prior to the most recent election (which had an astonishing 66% voter turnout). But still, what causes 33-50% of people to forgoe the opportunity to decide their own fate? Is it the reassurance that someone else will and that it will be good enough? I certainly have felt that way before, though that thought has never led me to skip a vote. 

Sometimes the state of the world seems too poor, too broken for me to even participate, much less contribute to its improvement. Recycling, carbon footprints, volunteerism, community involvement, charitable donations, alumni contributions, sustainable manufacturing, local business, black-owned business, woman-owned business, LGBT-friendly business, American labor, child-free labor, ethical consumption. The world is so full of consumer traps, it almost seems better not to consume altogether. And, honestly, I might genuinely agree with that sentiment. But I also really like my Macbook so like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
