Today was a long day. I was with Caroline in the morning, and by the time I had returned this evening, we both felt like it had been days since we had seen each other. 

Sometimes life can be frustrating. There are truths about life that are difficult, a degree of continuity that prevents one from enjoying their life first and work for it second, for example. I suppose there are ways that one could make some things happen in reverse--eating their dessert before their dinner--but in general, it feels very inaccessible to live in this way. There is a reason that people talk about the golden years and lament the fact that those years don't come until the latter part of people's lives while their best years are spent at a desk.

I spoke with a friend tonight about applications for new jobs and the market in general. There are lots of good opportunities out there, but everything has a catch. There are great salaries out there, but they want you to live in california, they want you to work on reprehensible products, or worse, they want you to work with douchebags. 

My friend finds himself in a pretty palatable situation. He makes enough money to support his family, they have time and resources to be happy together, and he likes the situation he has at work. He could make more money if he applied to other jobs, but he can't be guaranteed that he would have the same degree of comfort if he left his current situation. 

The thing that sticks out to me most about his situation is that he has enough for his needs and continues to live within his means. Many people, when they receive more, seek to increase the needs to fill up the totality of their means. I can be honest enough to say that I have fallen into this kind of situation as well. To be fair, I haven't been flippant about living outside of my means--I have went from renting to owning my house, and have moved more of my income to retirement funds and the like. It's not that I have been living ridiculously outside of my means, but that I have been actually funneling my income into the places they should be going. But it still feels like as my income increases, somehow my "needs" continue to increase with it. 

I wonder what it would truly take for me to meet my needs. If I could meet them, could I learn to be happy? I suppose identifying my needs would be the first step to answering this question.
