I have had a ton on my mind over the past day or so. Dustin and I made a video for our club, and I think it turned out really cool. I think it looks high quality, and I played a substantial role in the actual content of the video, as the writer, and Dustin put together an awesome video as the editor. I'm super excited about the prospect of how our content could turn out. I think we have a lot of skills that meld together for some long-standing content.

There is a lot to do. I don't quite have the time I need to it. But I'm doing my best. At times, parts of my life fall behind, and I wish that weren't the case. It seems inevitable, however. I've started to feel like life is a big game of hide and seek with death. I spend every moment robbing Paul to pay Peter. As long as I can keep everything in the air, it still technically counts as juggling.

I had a really big breakthrough in therapy yesterday. It didn't quite feel like a breakthough in the sense that I was really blocked by something and I finally emotionally broke through it. It was more like there was a large gem of emotional knowledge there that I finally discovered. That is kind of how therapy feels to me these days. When I first started therapy with my current therapist, I was in a pretty bad state mentally and emotionally. Each therapy session felt like a critical checkpoint for me on a journey that I might not complete. But these days, therapy is a really nice luxury where I get to experience growth in a sort of seeking way rather than escaping something negative.

My breakthrough was on the idea of the value of a person. A person is incredibly valuable. Every person deserves to be treated as valuable. 

In a parts work session, based on the IFS methodology, I saw myself as a tiny glass trinket. Something about me seemed precious and delicate. I saw hands pick me up. The hands were pretty normal in appearance, but I knew they were massive given that the hands were the main cause for my tiny appearance. I watched the hands pick me up gently, holding me as if the slightest movement could cause me to fall and break. I saw these hands as the hands of a god, holding me with care and the affection due to an item so fragile and valuable. However, something about how the hands held me felt unsure, as if the giant, powerful hands were worried that they might drop me. And I felt sympathy for that. I felt forgiveness for any accident that may happen that would cause me to fall and be hurt. 

That was when I had my secod realization: accidents happen. If I could feel sympathy for someone so powerful that they could hold me delicately in their hands, how could I possibly lack patience for m peers who will inevitably harm me and who hardly have a faction of the might of a cosmic god?

Not all who harm are bad. In fact, most harm is not a matter of evil at all. Most harm comes at the hands of those who would do us the least of it. Yet, their ceasingless attempts to make us happy are the same things that make us cry. Boy don't I know it, as someone who is absolutely incompacitated by my love for my partner and yet I sometimes feel like I can't stop making her cry ðŸ˜­ <- that's me, not her, though she apparently could apparently be represented by the same emoji

So I had reached the conclusion that I was of unfathomable worth and should be treated as such, but that I would inevitably suffer unintentional harm at the hands of those who love me. 

But,

What am I to do about intentional harm? This was my next realization--which came not as a cosmic experience like the imagery of glass trinkets and god hands, but rather as the logical acceptance of the contradictory truth of my value and care--that people who would harm me intentionally should not be allowed to handle me. There, of course, is some leway to intentional harm, as people are imperfect and capable of committing errors. So, those who develop a pattern of non-trivial intentional harm are no longer allowed to handle me. I will not make myself vulnerable to these people. Additionally, I will not allow myself to be handled by those who would neglect me, that is, those who develop a pattern of causing me non-trivial harm unintentionally. The term trivial here being entirely subjective, but essentially I see this as being the difference between mistakes, crossing boundaries, and failing to respect boundaries. 

A mistake is an isolated harm. It doesn't have to be a pattern, it doesn't have to be intentional; people fuck up.

Crossing a boundary is harm that causes me to need to express a boundary with someone. Whereas a mistake can be "hey, I didn't like that." A boundary is "Hey, I don't like when you do this. I would appreciate if you made an effort to avoid doing that in the future." It establishes a clear general rule of behavior. I don't necessarily think boundaries are sacred in any sense, some boundaries are simply unreasonable, but a well thought out boundary can be communicated clearly, and thus, respected or not.

Once a boundary has been set, if it continues to be disregarded, the person is either negligent or malicous, and thus cannot be allowed to handle precious items.

The thing that made me realize this distinction is the difference between the sitiation that happened with my friend a couple months ago and the small miscommunications that occur between me partner and me. In the situation with my friend, she was unwilling to accept responsibility, communicate, and demonstrate any desire to own the act of caring for me in a delicate way. Her mistakes, failures to be gentle, and active harms were not a problem in her eyes--they were my lack of grit, self-awareness, and thick skin. 

This is not the kind of attitude I seek in someone to care for me. The failure to accept my feelings when you are the one who hurt me is not the kind of care that a friend would offer. 

On the other hand, my partner and I have miscommunications on a regular basis. They are not the kind of thing that I feel that I hold on to. I don't feel that I walk on tip toes around my partner or react overly sensitively because of past conversations. Instead, when one of us is hurt, the other listens intently and seeks to understand what caused the hurt. The offender is eager to know how they can remedy the situation, and a deep sense of regret is felt between us. 

We don't expect each other to be perfect, but we do put in a sincere effort to be perfect for each other, without that expectation. I can say truly that I think she is my perfect partner. I could not imagine anyone being a better fit for me than her.
