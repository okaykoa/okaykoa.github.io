So I'm a little annoyed rn. That same friend is acting v weird and cancelled last minute on some group plans. Her husband said it was a work conflict, but when I texted her to tell her I was sad about her work conflict, she said it wasn't a work conflict but that she thought she wasn't invited... but then she shared some text screenshots (why did she feel like she had to send that?) to show that she felt like she wasn't invited and the texts were literally invites... it was super sus and I'm tired of dealing with this miscommunicative bs. 

That night when I saw her husband, I asked if it was a work thing again, and he said yes. I told him that she said it wasn't and he said it was a miscommunication. Anyway, I'm just annoyed at how this friend has been behaving. It's childish and innapropriate and I don't think I can put up with this any more.

On the other hand, I'm having the absolute best time with Caroline. She makes me so happy and I couldn't imagine life without her at this point. I went out to those plans with her, and I just had so much fun. It feels weird to have somebody genuinely love my company so much, someone who understands me and loves me the way I am, even when I'm a doofus and embarassing and insecure. I always knew that this kind of love existed, but I doubted for a long time that I could find it. I still don't quite know what I did to find it, much less deserve it. But I did. It's probably just as simple as being the luck of the draw, and I couldn't be more grateful for that <3.
