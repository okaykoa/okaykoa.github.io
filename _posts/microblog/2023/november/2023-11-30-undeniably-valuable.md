You know what kind of sucks? Confronting the reality of your own insecurities. 

I’m constantly thinking about the ways that people might find me annoying or inconvenient. Now that I write about it, I’m sure they aren’t even thinking about me. But, for some reason, in the moment of spending time with people, taking up their attention and time, I can’t help but feel that I am a waste of the same. 

There is a part of me that wishes that I brought undeniable and unmistakable value to people’s lives. But something about what I have to offer feels… questionable. 

The flaw in the thinking behind the feeling (the feeling not really capable of being wrong), is that I have to provide clearly positive value or that my existence is meant to be constantly productive to all the people that experience it. 

I am a person. An entity that is constantly changing. Often we use words like learning, growing, and becoming. These words are far more value-driven and purpose-oriented than the truth needs to be. Existence doesn’t have to be teleologically good. I don’t have to make someone feel only happy, bring them only productive conversations, only add value to their life. It is possible for my existence to be burdensome, sad, and expensive. It is okay for me to need time, to need attention, to require patience, understanding, and lovingkindness. It’s okay for my benefits to be unreciprocated. 

I am not perfect. Existence is not perfect. Only artifice is truly perfect. The constructs of the mind, the desires of the heart, the ideations of daydreams. 

To expect the experience of me to be perfect is to deny my very existence. What I am includes the reality that I taste sour, bitter, and rancid at times. This is what brings about the joy when I don’t. In fact, it is the fact that I taste such ways that make other people seem so sweet. And it’s the same qualities in me that make my changing self seem sweet. And I will continue to develop my taste and flavor profile. 

Being unappreciated, being unappreciateable, are not causes for distress but hope.

Today Caroline met several members of my family. We spent time cooking with my mother, chatting with my father, and brief moments in proximity to my brothers. I am hoping tomorrow we will have more time to spend with them in particular, though my sister will be in town with her bf and we will be spending a lot of time celebrating them as well. 

We went to Deception Pass and spent some time enjoying the views and the nature there. That was a really nice, albeit cold, time. 

We had dinner with a few members of the family, and we had drinks with some of my friends. 

It was an excellent, and long day. And I’m looking forward to another excellent and long day tomorrow
