I'm not in a very good mood today. I actually want to write feelings here that I wont. I probably should write them down or find some way to vent about them, but definitely here is not the place where I want to do that.

I worked a lot today. That probably has something to do with it. I gave my best hours and energy to a stupid product to fill the pockets of the people who own the corporation I work for. I am more than fairly compensated by way of comparison to my avarage peer, but the meaninglessness of the product, the job, and the system that my capitalist cooperation benefits is a serious drag on my mood, hope, and overall outlook on life. 

I had a good workout today. That's important to me as losing weight and feeling better about my overall health has been a year-long goal of mine. In the last part of the year, I started to lose momentum in my goals. But in the past couple weeks, I've been more dillient and motivated. I hope I can keep that up.

And tonight I finally got to introduce Caroline to my friends Tyson and Natalie. They are people who I really like. Tyson has become a close friend over the course of the past year. Like, we weren't that close at all, but as I've spent more time with Tyson, I've discovered the sweet, kind heart that he has. Tyson is truly a gem of a person to be friends with. Natalie is someone I would really like to be closer with. She seems pretty introverted and probably like social interaction is difficult for her at times. But, every time I get to see her, she is such a lovely conversationalist. She has so many beautiful and insightful things to say and is genuinely interested in listening to and learning from other people. She is the kind of person that everyone feels lucky to spend time with. I was really glad I was finally able to coordinate time for Caroline to see and talk to two people who I really treasure.
