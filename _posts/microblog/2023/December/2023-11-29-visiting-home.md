Today we flew from slc to Seattle. We are going to visit my family and it will be the first time Caroline has met my parents and most of my siblings. She met Kalei, Grant, and Macy a few months ago, and that went really well (of course). But this weekend she will meet literally everyone else, including Finaâ€™s bf and future baby daddy, Gage. So it will be a really big, fast weekend. 

Caroline has been a really good sport about everything so far and I think itâ€™s going to be a really good weekend. But she is used to a much smaller and quieter family than mine. I hope she has a good time in spite of all the differences between my people and hers ðŸ˜…
