Today was another long day. But it ended on a good note.

Work was long, but also productive. I'm actually only working one more day in the month of December. That's pretty wild and has a lot to do with some administrative changes at my company which resulted in me having to use up quite a bit of PTO before the end of the year. But I guess I won't complain too much about the time off.

I went to the batting cages with Caroline this evening. She is so hot. She's really talented in everything softball and it makes for really fun dates and activities with her. 

After softball we went to In n Out for dinner. We were both pretty excited for it as we have been talking about liking their food a few years ago but neither of us had been in a while. It turned out that I didn't really care for anything at In n Out... I suppose Caroline's good taste has had too much of an effect on me and now I can't enjoy junk food as much as I used to... I guess we'll just have to go get sushi next time ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Caroline and I spent a really nice evening together, talking and watching TV. We had some really good conversation and took yet another step forward in our relationship. I really love her and appreciate everything she does that makes this relationship so great. I have never has a better or more communicative partner in my life <3
