I don't have much I want to write about today. It's not because today was a bad day, it actaully was a very good day. But I have a lot on my mind and I'm feeling the overwhelm of documenting my whole like while I try to live it in a fulfilling way. I'm emotionally satiated, and it's a bit difficult to find the motivation to complete the things I want to do with my time.

I started the day with Caroline. It was a lovely start to the day. I had a great work day, getting a lot of stuff done and feeling very productive. Then in the evening I had a meeting with some friends where we talked about the ice bath activity we did yesterday. All-in-all it was a very good day.

Additionally, I had a lot of good ideas today. I really do need to write them down and I think I'm going to do that now.
