I am so tired today. I didn't sleep super well last night, but then I got up early this morning to workout with Kip. 

Kip is a huge dude who is super strong that I met through Dustin. We've been talking about meeting up to work out for a bit and we finally made it happen. He spent a lot of time talking me through the workouts and his workout philosophy. It wasn't really stuff I needed to know, but he is also super strong and well built, so there is no reason for me to act like I'm above hearing his advice. I certainly could use it.

The workout was a lot of fun. I would love to go to the gym with Kip again. 

I went in to the office today just to see my coworkers one last time before I take the rest of the year off. That was really nice. My coworkers were really nice to me and it was really good to see them. I wish I had a little bit slower of a day today so I could have enjoyed my time with them a little more. 

The office was also pretty busy today, and that kind of made me feel anxious. I really didn't care for the loud, crazy atmosphere of the office today. In fact, the area around my desk is always really busy and I really don't care for it. I wish it was a little quieter so I could focus on work without being so overstimulated. 

I left work early today to run a few errands.

First, I stopped by Guitar Czar in Murray to pick up some merch from one of the band members of Folk Hogan, a local band in Salt Lake. That was pretty cool as I got to hear a little bit about his favorite things about touring in Europe. 

Then, I went to Six Sailors Cider to go to a film director's club meetup. I'm not a film director, but I talked to Dustin and told him that we definitely had to go to the meetup as it aligned a lot with what we were trying to do with the club we have been creating. The person who runs the meetup ended up being the person behind the Save the Pantages movement in Salt Lake. He was really interesting and it was really cool to get a couple hours of face time with him. I'd say I got a lot of value out of going to that meetup.

Finally, I ended the night with some time with Caroline and her friend, Hannah. It was nice quiet time where we all worked on our own pastimes and creative projects. I could defintely go for more time like that.

It was a really good day, albeit a long one and I'm really ready for bed.
