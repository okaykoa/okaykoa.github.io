Today was yet another day that went by too fast. I spent the morning with Caroline, tidying up the house and whatnot. I ran out to the store to pick up a few groceries that she didn't already have for preparing some breakfast bowls for the rest of the week. With her is always a great way to start the day. I look forward to the day when we live together. 

I made sure to go to the gym today, and my workout was good enough. I wasn't able to do some cardio today because I had to hurry to Jeff's house for dinner and spending some time with him, Kimberly, and their friend Tom, who I met today. Hopefully, I will be going tyo the Faroe Islands with Jeff and Tom at the end of next year. 

When I got home I found out some bad news and decided to spend some time playing video games with the friend who the news affected. It's always sad when a friend is going through a tough time. i'm really fortunate to be able to support friends in a lot of ways due to havingt a pretty flexible lifestyle. I really designed my life to be able to have that flexiblity. I worked hard and sought out opportunities that would eventually led to a priveledged life. I've been very fortunate in a lot of ways. 

I'm glad that I got to talk to Caroline once she was done with work today too. I really love my relationship with her. I do miss her all the time, even though I get to see her most days. Life has been really good with her. Like I already said, I'm very fotunate in a lot of ways.
