Life has been really busy and I haven't had the same level of energy I want to have for writing in this journal. What I have been writing here has been a little uninspired lately, but that's not because my life has been lacking in depth, emotion, and inspiration.

My days are oftn filled with time and love with Caroline and McGee. I love every moment I get to spend, completely engulfed in feelings of appreciation and tenderness for and from them.

My mind is often on writing, and the topics I think of are fulfilling to me in thought, emotion, and something that feels like it transcends the two. I'm not a spiritual person, but whatever I am has been confused with spirituality before. I've been seeking meaning in a life that I have accepted has none. I'm making funny little designs and patterns where it really matters very little. I'm falling, but holding both hands high above my head so the picture wil show that I did. And seeking this meaning is somehow bringing me joy.

I told someone about the club I have been creating with my friends. They asked what it was about and I was surprized to be able to describe it so efficiently. I called it a philosophy and kindness club, where friends who are intersted in philosophy and finding meaning in life decided to conduct experiments and post derrivative content to the internet. He asked what kinds of things we do, so I told him that we did an ice bath last week. He started to talk about the health benefits of ice baths and I told him that our group kind of concluded that the health benefits are still inconclusive at the moment. He asked how we concluded that and I realized that I was negatively assessing something that he was very enthusiastic about. I tried my best to walk back in a kind way, but it may have been too late. I talked about the reduction in inflamation being good for high performance athletes and people who have the purpose of acutely reducing inflamation but also explained that the chronic reduction of inflamation in this way has been shown to reduce the body's ability to heal and recover muscles that need it. So it really depends on the individual needs. In attempting to mee him halway, I talked about the club's orientation towards thoughts, feels, and reals, allowing us to explore topics in logic, emotion, and acceptance of facts, which led us to our inconclusive position. Like I said, it may have been too late to walk it back ðŸ˜…

All in all, it was a really good day, and I'm really happy to be alive.
