Today was a really good day. Unfortunately, I had to work on a day off... I only worked a couple hours, but it was enough of a disruption to an otherwise good day.

I spent a lot of the day with Caroline. We had some good food and spent some really nice time together. And when I was working, Caroline was able to spend a little time painting. I'm glad she was able to get a little bit of time for that since she hasn't had much time for painting lately. That's been a new hobby for her and she is often disappointed that she doesn't have more time to practice or enjoy it.

It's time for bed now... I'm hoping to have a little more productive day tomorrow.
