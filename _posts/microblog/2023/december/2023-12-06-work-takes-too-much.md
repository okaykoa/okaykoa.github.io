Today was a busy day, like all days. I don't really have much to say. I worked quite a bit and was pretty productive. I also got a couple things done that I needed to get done. 

Life moves so quickly these days. I don't really care for it. The number one cause of my sense of rush is work. I wish work didn't take up such a large portion of my time, my emotional energy, and my thoughts. Work shouldn't be as central to my life as it is, as central to life as it seems to be for so many people. There has to be a better way to do this.
