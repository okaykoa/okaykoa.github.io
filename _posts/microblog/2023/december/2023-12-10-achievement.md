Today was yet another long day. It started out nice, in typical fashion, with a walk with Caroline and McGee and breakfast prepared by Caroline. I told Caroline that I wanted to prepare breakfast, but she ended up making it. Not because I didn't follow through but because she is really good at making breakfast and started the process and then finished it lol. I really love everything she makes. I used to think that I was pretty good at making breakfast, but she has really put my limited skills to shame. Food has been at the center of a lot of our relationship, from restaurants that we've gone out to and frequented to foods that we've cooked together (though the less involved I have been the better the meal has been...). 

It's not that I'm a bad cook but that Caroline is a really good one. When we visited her parents, I realized just how deeply cuisine runs in her family. That was one of the highest quality culinary weekends of my life, and I legitimately can't think of one that contends with it. 

I have been feeling okay lately. Really busy and a little disappointed with how much I am able to do in a day. There are so many things that I would like to do with my time, worthwhile activities and goals, but I simply don't have enough to realize all of them. I think I am still in a bit of a stage of denial about how much I should be able to accomplish with my life. 

When I think of the great people in history, the ones who really stood out and left their mark on the world, I realize just how much of a sacrifice it was to accomplish that which they did. It came at the cost of much of their personal comforts, luxuries, and probably personal relationships and emotional wellbeing. I don't envy them regarding the sacrifices they made, but I do wish there was a way for me to realize the things that I really thing would be neat to bring into existence...

Unfortunately, I think that is all I have time to say tonight. 

Goodnight.
