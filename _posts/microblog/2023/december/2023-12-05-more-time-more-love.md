Today was another long day. I just wish the days were just a bit longer so I could do more of the things I really want to do and less of the things that I have to do...

Work is really fine. Like, I actaully have a cool and fun job. But it takes up so much time every day and drains so much of my energy. Then, when I consider the other things that I have to do in a day (like go to the gym, clean the house, make food, go shopping, etc.), it doesn't leave too much time for the things that are actually meaningful to me--the passions that I have that I really think deserve to be realized. 

For the most part, I actually have a realy good job that does give me the mental, emotional, and financial flexibility to see fulfillment outside of work hours. I'm just lamenting that life isn't perfectly designed for my enjoyment.

I have been thinking a lot about my relationship with Caroline today (typical). She really is the best partner I have ever had. The way that she is so patient with the things that I thought were unlovable. That's not to say that she necessarily loves those parts about me, but that fact that she loves me in spite of knowing those things, seeing my imperfections, my lack of virtue, my vices, and she still loves the whole me. 

I guess maybe it's a bit weird to think that the ugly parts of us make the whole thing unlovable. That's a bit of a stretch. I certainly still eat my PB&J even though the bread has crust (let's be honest, I'm one of those weirdos that likes it because it has crust. Fuck uncrustables). So why would my infrequent lack of patience, my passing poor grammar, or any of the little things that others have found annoying bother her? Maybe in my mind it makes sense because others found it annoying, but the other's aren't her. The others didn't love me like she does, they didn't love me as good as she does. 

Idk man. I don't know what to do about it, but I just love her and feel so grateful for her every day. I wake up and feel so lucky to be with her and go to bed feeling the exact same way. I can't wake up tomorrow and feel this full of love for her all over again. <3
