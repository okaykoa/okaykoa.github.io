Well, it's tomorrow again. 

It's kind of hard to find time to write at night. Night happens to be when I feel the most creative. Some of my best projects and writings have happened between the hours of 10 PM and 2 AM. So, when I'm feeling more motivated and creative is when I feel I want to dedicate more time to larger forms of creativity. 

But on the other hand, I know I want to try to go to bed as early as possible. There is something energizing about getting up earlier in the morning. Rising with the sun and seeing the world wake up. I like to head out to nature with the sunrise when possible.

So these two forces--my drive to create and my drive to go to bed--press together, creating a sort of pressure that sometimes makes it difficult for me to want to make time (5 minutes even) to journal.

At some point this afternoon, I realized that I did a lot of hard things today. I did things I didn't want to do and was accountable only to myself. Something about that feeling of accountability, which was solely for my own benefit and to my own values, created a positive sense that the world is right, that I am right. 

I had told a coworker that I would go into the office today, but when I woke up, I had a strong pysical urge to not go in. THe mixture of tired, lazy, and the general comfort of not having to put on office appropriate clothing had me wanting to simply call it in. But for some reason I wanted to be true to my word, and my word was that I was going in. So I did. I didn't particularly enjoy my time at the office. The meeting I was needed for only took about 15 minutes. But I derrived most of my positive feeling about my decision to go into the office from the fact that I kept my word.

Lunch at the office was pizza. And I was very tempted to just eat pizza for lunch. However, I have been on a serious health journey (which is mostly oriented around my weight, I plan to write more about this at some point) since the beginning of this year, and eating a well-balanced diet has been tantamount to my goals and success. 

Recently, I learned about the importance and role of fiber in a diet and that most Americans consume only half of the fiber that they need. That was a shocking discovery. I'm sure that before I started on this health endeavor, I ate quite a bit less fiber than I do now, and even now I haven't been meeting my daily needs. 

So I was proud of myself for first filling my plate with salad, covering a broad specturm of nutrients (greens, protein, various vitamins, fiber from edamama and kidney beans, and a side of fruit). After finishing my salad I went back for a single slice of pizza, which satisfied my craving.

Then later, I was sorely tempted to not go to the gym. I was feeling a little hungry and tired and had a bit of a headache. I just felt lazy about completing my workout. This was the momemnt that I realized that I had done a lot of things I didn't want to do today. And that's also when I became determined to do this thing too. 

I had a great workout. I hit a PR on bench (245 x 3 x 5 + 1!), though I had a little pain in my bicep that hindered me from finishing a few auxiliary lifts.

The end the day, I had a difficult conversation. Unfortunately, the conversation was sort of pried out of me, rather than me bringing it up on my own though I knew I should. I wish I was better at initiating effective communication, but sometimes it's difficult to trust that expressing your needs is more important than "keeping the peace." I put quotes around "keeping the peace" because failing to initiate effective communication likely means that I am commiting some kind of protest behavior (think, holding a grudge or passive aggressiveness), which I absolutely was doing, in spite of genuine attempts not to and some self-deception about those genuine intentions...

It wasn't a perfect day. I could think of much better ones. But it was a fulfilling day because I engaged with the demands on my life and my own held values. It was a good day.
