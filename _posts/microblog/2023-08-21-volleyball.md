I joined a volleyball team in SLC. I've been wanting to play volleyball all summer, with one friend in particular who is very busy and popular. Though he has wanted to play too, he has just been too busy (and popular). But a few weeks ago he told me he joined a volleyball team, which I envied a little bit. But a few days later he asked if I wanted to join too :)

We had another game last night. It went well enough. Our team hasn't won a single game since I've joined. We are not very good... I am not a bad volleyball player, but I don't have any formal experience with the sport. In fact, this is the first organized team I've ever played on. But it's still fun to get out to Libert Park in SLC, around a bunch of active folks who are having a good time. The energy is good, and even if my team isn't that great at volleyball, I can still do my best and enjoy playing a sport that I really do enjoy.
