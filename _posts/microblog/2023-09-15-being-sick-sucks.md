I've been sick for the past few days. I had intended to write last night but my brain was too tired by the time I found time to write and I just couldn't commit to it. 

Being sick is super inconvenient. With all the work I've done this year in getting in shape and creating a schedule and routine for my day, being sick feels like it has really derailed a lot of that progress. This is fallacious thinking, of course. I can get back into a routine as soon as I put forth the energy and focus to make it happen, but the feeling of dissappointment is still there.
