Today was another great day. Though I started the morning a bit later than I would have liked, it did start the way I like. I did a little reading a writing before heading to a group meditation. 

The meditation was on the topic of love. It was a very easy meditation that didn't challenge my perceptions and worldviews at all. Where normally the meditations at this studio are a bit heady or intellectual, this meditation was very soft and kind, encouraging us to recognize several of the ways we love and are loved by others and self. At times, we were encouraged to embrace common self-critical thoughts and love them as we moved past them to love ourselves even further. It was a really good meditation.

One member of the meditation circle mentioned the line in the Beatles song, "The End," that says, "And in the end, the love you get is equal to the love you give." I thought this was very interesting as I made a connection between the experience of love and Solipsism. I think I will soon write an essay about my thoughts on love and solipsism.

After meditation, my friend and I got bagels at a shop next to the meditation studio and then headed up the Provo Canyon to dip in the river. It was a lovely afternoon for dipping in the cold river.

My friend and I have been forming a club for a few months now. It's a social club oriented towards creating positive spaces for mental, emotional, and ideological health. I may write more about it, but I also may not as this blog isn't meant to be promoted in any fashion. But I have been having a lot of fun thinking about the potential of this club. I think it is something that will really increase the value of my life and the few friends who are interested in participating. If it becomes something that extends beyond just our friends, I hope it provides that value to even strangers.
