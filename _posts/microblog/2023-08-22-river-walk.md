I'm writing this post tomorrow, only a few hours prior to when I anticipate writing tomorrow's post lol (It is currenlt 7:19 on August 23rd). I had planned on writing this post early this morning, but somehow I got caught up on getting started at work and didn't get around to writing this. It was a busy day, in which I didn't complete as much as I would have hoped, and that means I never felt that I could give myself the time to write this post like I had hoped...

Lately, my partner has been reading a book that is a sort of workshop for unlocking creativity. As she reads the book, she completes daily and weekly activities, one of which includes writing. It has been really nice to be around her as she's been reading this book, as it lines up pretty closley to when I started this public journal. I think part of my success in writing, and writing as much as I have in each post, is due in part to the time that she has been setting aside to write and work on her workshop as I have been able to write during those times as well. It's something I've really enjoyed as it has improved the quality of my life and has been a great way to spend time with her.

Yesterday (today, supposedly), I went on a walk with my friend. He took me down to the Provo River Parkway, and we did a 3 hour walk and talk. It was a beautiful night with beautiful conversation. This is a friend who has been very dear to me since I first met him, and he has been there for me in some big ways since then. It was a long walk, and I was tired when it was over. But walks like that are more than worth the time.
