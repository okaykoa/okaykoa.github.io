It's tomorrow and I want to talk about something that already happened, so I'm going to talk referentially (in time) from the moment it is now instead of from the perspective of the last moment last night like I usually do.

I've been posting some silly recipes for coffee that my partner makes. It's funny, I often tell her that she's ruining my life. She's ruining my life by ruining things that I like. For example, coffee. She makes such good coffee that I legitimately don't enjoy a lot of the coffee we get when we go out. It's few and far between when I find a coffee shop that makes coffee as good as some of hers, even farther between to find something _better_. This is a trend in our relationship. She has also ruined music, movies, yoga, breakfast, and--believe it or not--playing catch (she is such a great throwing partner 😍).

Well, this is all to say that, this morning, I tried making one of the coffee recipes I posted. The cinnamon vanilla mocha dirty chai recipe. And I did a bad job 😅. I followed the instructions, but I didn't really know how much an unlevelled spoon was, so I did sort of between a heaping spoon and a levelled spoon, which was a bit more (a lot more) of the sweet chai mixes than she does. The coffee was way to sweet for our pallates. My sister would have loved it tho lol.

Yesterday morning, my partner came down from SLC to Provo Canyon to do a morning water dip with my friends. My friends have this weekly tradition of heading up the provo canyon to dip into the water (which is typically accompanied by attending a group meditation nearby). It's always hit and miss with some of the friends, but I told them all that Caroline was coming down to dip and all my friends made a point to join yesterday. It was the biggest group we've had since the winter solstice almost a year ago, and I wasn't even there for that one!

It was so much fun to have Caroline meet a few more of my friends. I really like my friends. They are thoughtful, compassionate, smart, and funny. We spend a lot of time laughing at eachother and feigning shock or appal. It's always such a good time. One of my dear friends is really busy (not unlike Caroline) and they had not had the chance to meet until yesterday's water dip. It made me really happy to see them talking and connecting. That was a really, really good day.

Then, my partner had to head back up to SLC to go to work, but I kept McGee for the afternoon at my place. He was a little uncomfortable since he doesn't spend a lot of time at my place. We spend a lot of time together, but it's always at her apartment. So, though I tried to make him comfortable, and we did do a little napping and chilling on the couch, I don't think he ever fully settled in. 

But that evening I took him back up to her place in SLC and he was much more comfortable. We took a couple really good evening naps waiting for my partner to come home :)

My life is going really well right now and I'm very grateful for it. It's unfortunate that there is a small part inside of me that is afraid of being on such a high. There is a little fear that at some point this high will end. Things will stop getting better and they will get worse. How will that feel? Will I be okay having so much to lose now?

A couple years ago I was suicidal. I had hurt some people I really cared about without trying, and to be quite honest, by doing so much to love them that they felt guilty and created a narrative for themselves that I was manipulating them. Hearing them, in the same week, make accusations against me (and follow those up with public accusations--vague, and even untrue--in online spaces that would certainly make me look guilty to people in my circles), sent in down an emotional spiral that took my almost six months to recover from. Though they both rescinded every accusation against me, and are my friends to this day, the fear and emotional hurt that their careless accusations caused me made me want to cease to exist, severely, for a half of a year. And though I escaped the active desire to die after those 6 months or so, the lingering thoughts of wanting to not exist (what I might call passive suicidalness) stuck with me for more than a year.

Today, I no longer carry with me a desire to unalive myself. But I do carry strange thoughts on the ideas of suicide and death. Antinatalism, for example, is a philosophical movement I deeply understand and even connect with, though I don't prescirbe to any person or people.

In talking about the concept of death with a friend of mine who calls herself a transhumanist (in a grossly short summary: someone who wants to overcome death by technology), I told her that I don't want to overcome death. There is something about the finality of my mortality that is deeply comforting to me. One day, my suffering will end. My responsibilities will cease. The expectations placed on my being will no longer haunt me.

I texted her the other day. I told her: 

> you know that i look forward to dying. the thought of having to live forever sounds so, so dull.
> dating caroline has made me rethink how I feel about that.

Yeah, that's the long way of explaining the fear I have about life being so good right now. I know that I can fuck this up. 

But fuck it. It's really great. I'm having a great time. And she has shown me at every step that she will understand as I clumsily try to exist. I'm just really so grateful for the way my life is going. I didn't think this was where I would be and didn't think that I would ever be this happy.
