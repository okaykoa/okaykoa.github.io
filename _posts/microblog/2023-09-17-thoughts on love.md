I am genuinely the most happy I have been at any point in my life. 

I'm still coming off of a week of being sick and trying to get over that illness. I slept for a large portion of the day today. I took NyQuil way too late last night and ended up sleeping away most of my morning. I had to take a nap in the afternoon to catch up on the drowsyness that I felt when I woke up today. This is all to say, I am not feeling 100% today. There are things I could complain about. But I am genuinely the happiest I've ever been. 

Love is a hell of a drug. I don't even know much about what love is. I know that it is a physiological phenomenon that happens inside of us. That we feel love as a result of chemicals in our body that make us feel good. These chemicals can happen with many types of situations. They can be sexual, platonic, happy, sad. There are a lot of ways we can experience love like that. 

But on the other hand, sometimes we display love at times when we are not motivated by internal physiological phenomena. Sometimes we display understanding, compassion, patience, and the like at times when we feel the opposite and maybe even when totally different chemicals are at play in our body, telling us to do something totally inconsistent with the "love" chemicals. 

I think people have a pretty intuitive understanding of what "love" is. But I think people have a lot more love in them than even they realize. And anyone that tried to simplify love into a single definition is oversimplifying something that has many modes of expression and experience. 

I do feel incredibly loved rn. And I have a lot of love in me. I read Erich Fromm's The Art of Loving. In it, he said that when we love someone, that love increases the love we feel for others as well. I have seen that in my life. I am so in love with my partner. And in that, I have seen myself dedicating more and more time to her. But I still find myself trying to reach out and maintain relationships with many friends. I often feel exhausted trying to maintain my relationships and make time for everyone. But I feel so strongly connected to them and want to value their friendship like it deserves.

Likewise, as I am trying to be a better partner for Caroline, I see the ways that the improvements I make in showing up for her are benefiting and improving the ways I show up for others. I am seeing the efforts others are making in their relationships with me and I am able to better meet the needs of all my relationships as I strive to be a better partner to Caroline. I see that I have more patience, more understanding, and I am better able to receive all kinds of interactions, even ones that are less pleasant, and turn them into something positive. 

I think there is something about secure attachment styles. I'm not sure that I believe that a person is born with an attachment style or that it is something inherent to a person, but I do believe that the behaviors associated with attachment styles can be used to elicit certain feelings of security (or insecurity). I have seen the way that secure attachment behaviors have improved my relationship with Caroline, and as I have felt more secure in my relationship with her, I have seen the effects of that security outside of our relationship as well. I have seen myself being more patient at work and especially with a situation that happened recently with a friend of mine. 

I think that love is a complicated thing. There are lots of ways to look at love, and many of those are underappreciated by those who receive and even give it.
