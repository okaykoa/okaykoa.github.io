I am really greateful for the friendships that I have that allow me to be 100% honest. I don't feel like all my friendships are like this. In my experience, there is a certain kind of person who can handle honesty without dicomfort. Few people want to hear honesty, because honesty isn't always in the favor of the listener. The distance between how we already see the world and how someone else might see it may feel like physical miles when we hear it. 

I am not one of those people who seems almost immune to honesty. Honesty can hurt my feelings pretty easily, actually. I am one of those people who desires honesty, but that's not to say that I make it very easy for people to be honest by my reaction to it.

I feel like there are many thoughts and feelings that people have on a regular basis, that may be best left unsaid. Not all thoughts and feelings, though real and true, are productive or help[ful. 

I supposed this begs the question, "Do all things need to be helpful to be spoken?" And my honest answer is "no." But still, is the cost of someone else's discomfort worth saying something that I truly feel but may not provide any value? This idk. 

Needless to say, I had a conversation with a friend tonight. A sincere conversation where I felt comfortable saying things that I otherwise wouldn't. Not everything was bad; there are private thoughts that are positive too. And I am simply grateful to have this friend in my life.

I have a small group of friends that I gained through my partner. Central to this group of friends is her childhood best friend, then the best friend's partners, then the extended friend group. I really enjoy time with these folks. The things they think, read, and talk about are much less sticky than the things I typically talk about with my peers. They are free-flowing and spend time on hobbies that feel that way too. 

Last night they invited me to their house for a grilled cheese dinner. Everyone was expected to bring their own grilled cheese toppings (more than just cheese, I learned) and we were cooking our sandwhiches in a open fire. The vibes were emaculate.
