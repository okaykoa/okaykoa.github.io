We hiked Stewart Falls today, which is along the Alpine loop between American Fork and Provo Canyons. It was a nice day for a hike, even if a bit hot.

After the hike, my partner, her parents, and I went to Proper Burger in SLC. Proper Burger is a separate location right next door to the Proper Brewing Company. Burgers and beer are a great post-hike treat :)

Lately, I've been trying to use Effective Communication in my relationship. I read about Effective Communication in the book, "Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How it Can Help You Find--and Keep--Love". It has been really rewarding to see Effective Communication work in my relationship as my partner has been accepting of my feelings and needs. When my inclination is to withdraw from her in an attempt to have her chase me and fulfill my needs, clearly communicating what I feel and/or what I need has given her opportunities to show just how patient and caring she can be for me.
