You ever have one of those days that you think is going to be really good and then things just kind of nose dive? Today was one of those days. 

My day started in the absolute best way. I got to see my partner, go on a walk with her and her dog, have some breakfast _and_ some of her delicious coffee. All before even starting my workday. I thought it was going to be a really good day. 

Then I found out that there was a pretty big problem at work. Nothing I can't handle, but it just meant derailing any plans I had until it was addressed. By the end of the day, it was addressed, with a few pending actions for tomorrow.

But the kicker to everything was a text message I received late. I was texting a friend who I care very much about. I have been meanig to spend more time with the friend. In fact, I texted her earlier today to ask if she was free tomorrow. When I received a response, I realized I had texted another friend with the same name ðŸ™ƒ. Anyway, I have plans tomorrow night with the wrong friend lol.

After a few cordial text messages, my friend asked if she could say something that would hurt my feelings. I had a suspicion they were going to tell me that their feelings were hurt bc of the distance between us for a few months (several months, really). So I invited her thoughts. She then proceeded to tell me about her hurt feelings and the ways that she has gotten back at me for them. 

When I went to respond, I wanted to apologize, but I also wanted to understand the extent to which I had hurt her feelings. I was aware of some shortcomings, but I don't assume to be aware of every fault I commit. So I explained this to her: my intentions to apologize, make things better, and my desire for her to tell me the breadth of things I had done to hurt her feelings.

Her response shocked me. Instead of demonstrating any warmth or acceptance of my willingness to apologize, she said she wasn't sure she wanted to spend any effort on repairing our relationship. She said that I had done several things wrong, but she was not willing to tell me anything at the moment because she was not sure I was even her friend--that I was ever her friend.

This response caught me utterly off guard. It was hurtful, immature, and clearly was not intended to resolve any situation. Her words were meant to hurt me, to make me feel the pain that she felt about our relationship. 

I still don't quite know what I did to hurt my friend so badly. She did tell me one thing that I had done, which was trivial and something I would be happy to apologize for. But my apology was not something my friend was interested in. And I guess there's not much I can do about that. 

I'm really glad I have read so many self-help books lately. I think that recently knowledge and practice helped me to handle this situation with calmness. I know my friend did what she did out of her own hurt and anger. And these are feelings I'm all too familiar with. I can find it in myself to forgive her, but rn isn't the time for be to complain about the tone of her communication. My priority is meeting whatever emotional needs that have not been met for her. Once she knows that I am an active participant in this relationship, I hope she will see that she can communicate in ways that are far less emotionally damaging to me as her friend.
