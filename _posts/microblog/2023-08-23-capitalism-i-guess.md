Well, it's a few hours later. 

Today was a bit of a rough day at work. I struggled with some of the tooling that I use on a regular basis. I recevied a new machine (computer) at work this week, which means I have a lot of tools to set up. It's been a while since I've set up a numnber of those tools, and I'm not the strongest engineer (in general but), specficially when it comes to systems. So I just barely logged off, still feeling a bit underaccomplished on the day. 

This brings the woes of capitalism to the forefront of my mind...

Only recently have I been able to actually grasp the core principle of capitalism (I'm sure I will regret publishing this crude attempt in a public journal someday...). The essence of capitalism is that one or at least a small group of individuals invest capital (money) into the creation of an industrial institution (a business). The institution hires employees who provide labor for a wage. As labor is completed and products are sold, the profits from the sale of goods exceed the expenses needed to produce said goods. This excess, at least in part, is paid back to the investors (the return on their investment). The critical component of capitalism being that the laborers must be paid less than the value they provide to the company. Though they make less money than the value they provide, they have a wage that (ideally) is stable and sufficient for their needs. And, of course, the investors make money on their investment.

Though our current economic system is far more complex than this simple explanation of "capitalism," this is generally the core principle of the system.

I'm not particularly fond of it. But of course I'm not: I'm one of those undervalued laborers... even if I am doing well by comparison to the population as a whole. 

This was such a tanget away from anything that I had thought about and intended to write about during the day. smh.

I'm feeling rather uncertain today. The details I will refrain from publishing on the internet. But I did want to log that feeling here at least, if not for myself then for the sake of candor.
