With meeting my partner's parents over the weekend and working from her house a couple times already this week, it has been a busy and exciting week already.

Tonight I went to the Barbie movie with a group of friends. One of these friends has wanted to create a social group for philosophy, mental health, and self-care. I have taken to calling it a philosophy and being kind club lol. I have been involved in a lot of the creation and planning in this club and it's been pretty fulfilling to be involved in something like this. The goal of the club is to proide a lot of the benefits that organized religion provides, but for folks who don't find themselves enjoying some of the other "benefits" that come with religion. We try to provide things like community, conversations on philosohpy and ethics, social support, etc.

Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling very well towards the end of the movie, so I went home after instead of hanging around with the rest of the group as they discussed the philosophy from the film. That's typically my favorite part of the club as we combine an activity with a discussion. I wish I could have been there to hear more thoughts from the group, but I did benefit from spending a little time laying on my bed scrolling through memes.
