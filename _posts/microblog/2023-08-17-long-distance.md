Today was really fun. I talked to 4 long distance friends on the phone after work today. That's so many, and I felt very tired when I finished my last call, but I love being able to maintain relationships with great people in spite of distance. 

I value the relationships I have. I have felt that I tend to hold on to relationships for a long time, even if I haven't spoken to people in many years. I hold space for those people in my heart, think of them, and wish them the best that life can offer. And I'm always happy to cross paths with them again later in life, even if over the phone :)

I have a regularly scheduled meeting with some overseas vendors. These meetings are often late at night. While it's inconvenient to have to get back on my work computer for a bit when I'd like to be heading to bed (or maybe out at a concert), I really enjoy working with folks around the globe. I have come to really enjoy working with this overseas vendor in particular, so it's always a pleasure to meet with them. I would really like to visit them onsite sometime.
