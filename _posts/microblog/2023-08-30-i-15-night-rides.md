Today started out pretty tough. I was still trying to recover emotionally from the message I receveied from my friend for most of the morning. In addition to that, I had a pretty high priority situation at work I had to take care of. Fortunately, the people I work with are very helpful and competent, so I was able to get everything done and not without help from some of my coworkers.

Just when I was starting to feel okay about the situation from my friend, I finally heard back from her. It wasn't much, but it was enough to make me anxious again. She just said she would respond later. I really am so thankful for the literature I've been reading lately. I think it has helped me stay fairly emotionally level as this situation has unfolded.

I was pretty busy today. In addition to the regular work stress and this situation with my friend, I had also made dinner plans with some friends that I really like but don't see very often. It was so nice to see them. We talked right through 4 hours. They are very interesting, smart, and kind people. I could have stayed and chatted quite a bit longer. And I woul sure like to see them again soon :)

I rode my motorcycle out to their place. I really like freeway riding. With the new bike I just bought, I find that I'm a bit more aware of my mistakes as a rider. I definitely don't feel as nimble on a 1200CC Harley as I did on a 650CC Suzuki. But, I've really enjoyed the smooth ride at high speeds that I get with the bigger, heavier bike. Night riding is evern better, at least here in Utah. I-15 is well lit through the large majority of the corridor around SLC, and around 10 or 11, there is a lot less traffic. It's just a nice, aesthetic ride. It's one of the few times that I feel like a badass lol.
