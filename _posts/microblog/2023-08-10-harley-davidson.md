I rode my motorcycle to the office today--on the same part of I-15 that was backed up for an hour yesterday. I took a motorcycle course last summer, thinking I might enjoy trying something new. I ended up loving riding motocycles and thought I'd rent for a couple years until I could save up for a motocycle. 

Anyway, I bought a motocycle first thing this year, outgrew it, and traded it in for a Harley Davidson.

This evening my roommate gave me some ice cream he made with his Ninja Creamie, which is unfortunately named but makes killer ice cream.

And I ended the night with a phone call with an Uncle who was a big part of my childhood. It was a good day.
