Today was yet another great day. It started off with a morning walk with my partner and her dog. This is one of those everyday activities that probably feels like a burden to most people. And tbh, there are some mornings when I want to stay in bed or some nights when I'm really tired and just want to go to bed. But truly, once I'm out on a walk with these two, I'm the happiest guy in the world. I care about them very much, and spending time with them makes me feel so alive. Yeah, I'm in love, what about it?

My partner wasn't feeling well tho. She was sick yesterday, enough so to come home early from work and just relax. Then last night she didn't sleep well at all, so it was another sick day for her. That made me sad of course, but the prospect of working from home with her there was something I was really excited for. So it was a nice relaxing day with her at home while I got some work done. 

Then I had volleyball again, which was fun. We met up a little earlier with some extra friends to play some grass volleyball before our sand league. Honestly, the quality of volleyball with those extra friends was much better than our team. Our team is mostly people who don't play volleyball... and the friends who are willing to make some time to play volleyball at the park are far more interested and experienced. So I enjoyed the pre-game volleyball much more than I usually enjoy the league. 

But maybe it paid off because we won our first TWO games of the season last night! Which means we won the match. That was fun at least :) 

I picked up some gyros on the way home from volleyball to have with my partner and we just had a nice relaxing rest of the night. It was a really good day.
