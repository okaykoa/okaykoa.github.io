Today was one of those days that feels near perfect, even if it doesn't match what I would describe as "the perfect day."

Today was a work day, first and foremost, which I feel automatically disqualifies it from perfection. But, even the workday itself was enjoyable. 

It was a wfh day from my partner's house, and she had the day off to boot. While I worked, she made us breakfast tacos (one of my favorites that she makes, but everything she makes before noon is delicious) and coffee (omg her coffee is delicious too. I've thought about learning her coffee recipes and adding them to this blog post). We enjoyed breakfast together before I headed over to her apartment's shared office space to continue working and give her some space to clean and paint.

Today we had a company meeting, which always follows an earnings call. These company meetings are mostly meant for the senior leadership to celebrate a good fiscal quarter (improving morale) or to justify a poor fiscal quarter (also improving morale... hopefully). But this means that these meetings have little to do with my work or my team, and I don't have really any role to play in these meetings. So I have found these meetings to be a great time to go to the gym while listening in from my phone. And honestly, these company meetings have been one of my favorite times at work because I can get a work out on the clock without missing any of the work or responsibilities I need to take care of that day. 

After work, my partner and I went to our favorite restaurant in SLC, Sapa Sushi. We love it so much that we've had to agree on a once-a-month limit to our visits to the restaurant lol. We were supposed to take a friend there as a thank you for letting us borrow a rooftop tent this summer for a camping trip, but he was sick and couldn't make it... So I guess we'll have to go again sometime! :)
