I spent almost all of today with my girlfriend's dog. That's something that I've really enjoyed doing this year. Because I can work from home, I sometimes work from her apartment and hang out with him while she's at the office. It's a win win win (well, except that she's not there too...).

There was terrible traffic on I-15 this morning when I was on my way to her apartment. It took me over an hour to drive to my work (which is normally 10 minutes away) and then proceed to drive right past it to my girlfriend's apartment.
