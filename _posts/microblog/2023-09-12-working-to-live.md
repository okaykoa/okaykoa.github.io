Yesterday was a pretty good day for one that was fairly normal. I was able to get quite a bit of work done and get closer to checking off all the things on my list. That's something that I haven't been able to do in quite some time given that work has been prett busy, and always increasingly so for the past several months, maybe even a year. 

Generally, work has been pretty unfulfilling for me. There have been high points for sure, but I don't feel like I'm particularly skilled in the areas I need in order to be a high performing contributor at work. Don't get me wrong, I am skilled, but the skills I have are never put to use in the role I have now. 

I have sought growth in the direction of what I currently do. A few years ago I asked my boss if it would be possible to get me more generalized software development training. I floated the idea of a boot camp as a way to get me the necessary foundation that I seem to be missing. He really liked the idea, but it was stopped at funding. Then, a year later, the same problems persisted and I asked my new boss the same question. He felt the same way as my previous boss but, again, funding was the issue. We made arrangements for me to level up on the job, which was successful for a short spurt of time before we had layoffs and work started to get really busy. That was about a year ago so I guess that's the answer to how long work has been increasingly busy. 

Finally, I asked my boss again (for the third year in a row) for software dev training. At this point, one of two things must be true: either the training is truly necessary or I am simply not adecuate for my job. That's an uncomfortable truth. The thing is, I'm in localization and have my hands in internationalization as well. Very few people in localization have the skills for internationalization. Typically, if you have the skills for internationalization, you are a software developer who got roped into the globalization side of software. It's pretty uncommon for someone to be in localization and make the move to internationalization, precisely because the software development skillset is far more difficult to obtain.

I would really like to make that switch, but I just don't have the means to learn that on the job. I already have a job, a good job; I don't have the impetus to learn new skills on my own time for the sake of finding a new job and definitely not for making myself better at the job I already have. Maybe I would be happier at my job if I used personal time and resources to make that happen, but I just can't justify that expense in my life. 

I don't seek life fulfillment from my job. It is simply a means to a financial ends that helps me find fulfillment outside of my job. I like that relationship. I do wish I was better at my job, but using my own personal resources to improve my ability to participate in the capitalist industrial complex is not the kind of investment I'm really all that interested in...

Apart from work, my volleyball team forfeited yesterday because most of the team couldn't make it. So I went to the gym and had a really good workout instead. Then I did some tidying up around my partner's apartment while I waited for her to come home. In spite of it sounding like a very normal day, it was a really good one.
