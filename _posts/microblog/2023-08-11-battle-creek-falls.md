Today started off with a short hike to Battle Creek Falls. It was my first time seeing the falls, but my friends told me that the falls are much stronger this year due to the heavy snowfall earlier this year. It was fun to walk all the way up to the waterfall and dip in the water a little bit.

I went into the office today and listened to the ATC radio again with my coworkers. Today I did finally hear my partner and everyone was pretty excited to actually hear her today. :)

I had a handful of conversations today with friends. Several of them touched on personal or heavy topics. I'm really glad I'm able to be a friend to so many interesting and kindhearted people. The multiple conversations did leave me feeling a little emotionally spent.
