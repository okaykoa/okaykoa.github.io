Today was another long day, but it was a really good one. I worked from my partner's house, but most from the office at her apartment complex. 

It was a busy work day with lots of meetings. I don't feel like I was able to complete everything I would have liked nor what I needed. Work is a funny thing. 

I don't necessarily have a problem with work, and I don't have any deeply-rooted problem with capitalism--like, I could genuinely care less--

_** Okay I have to interject here to tangent on "I could care less." So many people have strong opinions about whether it's "I could care less" or "I couldn't care less." Here's my opinion: either one works **and** makes sense. "I couldn't care less" means that it is the thing I care least about. Nice and simple; understood. "I could care less" has a transcendent quality where I care so little about it that I don't even bother to care least about it. Like, the thing that I care least about gets enough attention to be my active #1 least cared about thing. If I could care less, I don't even care enough to care less about it. I know that's difficult for some people to swallow, but if you have stronger opinions about it, maybe you **should** care less._

... but I do deeply believe that there is so much more to life than work. So many of us seek life fulfillment in work, we seek identity, we seek the validation of our existence in completing tasks in exchange for a wage. I just think that's so sad. 

I think there is so much more to a person than what they are willing to do in exchange for money. I'm not the first person to say that the things that a person is willing to do for free say much more about who they are; and those things are often so much more interesting!

When I was done with work (ew), we went to see Tash Sultana at the Sandy Ampitheater. I had seen the Tash Tiny Desk concert on NPR, but I had never seen Tash live nor had I been to the Sandy Ampitheater. The concert was awesome. Tash was great, the music was great and they had this sort of 90's grunge/psychedelic live video production of the show on a screen. Like, it wasn't just a couple angles of the stage, but it  was a full production with closeups, fish eye lenses, and several cool angles of the performers on stage. Then all the video was edited with different psychedelic effects. It was really cool and made me hope that they post that video somewhere bc it would be fun to watch it high ;)

Last night I had a tender moment with my partner as well. Just some sweet pillow talk before bed. I do really love her so much and feel incredibly lucky to have her time and attention. There was a time when finding compatibility with a companion seemed unlikely for me. I didn't know if someone existed who I would want to intertwine my life with, much less someone who met all the things I was looking for and also loved me back. I know I have written a lot about her, and sometimes I feel self-conscious about being codependent or something like that, but the truth is I wake up every day and go to bed every night feeling so grateful, so heart-full to have her in my life. I have never been more excited and happy about my life, and it has a lot to do with the way she makes me feel.
