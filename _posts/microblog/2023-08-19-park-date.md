Today started with a lovely visit to Liberty Park in SLC with my partner and her dog. We stopped by the Bagel Project on our way there, had a lovely breakfast picnic, and then walked around the park. It was a couple hours under an overcast Utah sky and many smiles to start the Saturday. 

There was a moment during the picnic that I realized--I enjoy moments like these. A moment of relaxation, with nothing to do and nowhere to be. When spending time with the people I love doesn't feel like time spent, but rather time **_savored_**.

I thought about how I've spent much of my adult life preparing for my future, particularly my future career. So many weekends, saturday mornings, late nights were spent on my computer working on "passion projects." I don't regret this time of intense dedication to my professional future nor the benefits I now enjoy because of it. But, what I realized today is that I wish I had more moments like those I had at the park today. Where being was enough, rather than tirelessly becoming. My only objective this morning was eating, really enjoying my meal. There was no activity, no productivity; only sitting in a park, enjoying the pretty trees, and talking about how cute the dogs were. 

I don't know what life is about, but I would really like if my life was more about that.
