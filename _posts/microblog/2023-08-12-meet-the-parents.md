I met my girlfriend's parents today. We've been dating for the better part of a year, so it felt like an appropriate time to meet them.

Idk if it's because I'm in my thirties, but this kind of thing doesn't feel like as big of a deal as it used to. I mean, it was still important to me and I even got a bit nervous in the days and hours leading up to it. But, I think I'm probably more confident in the person I am and maybe there's a bit of acceptance that not everybody will like me and that I'm not the main character...

Either way, it went well enough for me. Her parents were kind to me in the ways they should be and likewise teased me in the ways they they should. My partner was nice enough to show me off by bringing up some of my more impressive qualities. I ended the day feeling very grateful for my partner and the relationship that we have <3
