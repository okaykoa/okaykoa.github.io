Today my partner had the day off, so I took it off too. We had a great day together, playing catch earlier in the day to avoid the heat, then heading to a coffee shop to read and write together. It was a very nice morning full of warm smiles, relaxing vibes, and three delicious coffees between the two of us.

In the afternoon we sat and talked, getting to know little bits of each other than we hadn't known before. I can truly say I've never been more in love with her. 

Then tonight we went to a local show at Piper Down Pub. Neither of us had seen a show at this bar before, but we were excited to check out a local spot. I had been there before but only for drinks with friends and karaoke; I've always seen it as a pretty dive-y local spot. While the venue was okay (definitely something we'd do again, but not much to write home about), the food ended up surprising us. It's all greasy spoon pub food, but pretty darn tasty.

We enjoyed the show as well. A local band, Folk Hogan, was playing a birthday show for their drummer. The crowd was all local and there was a lot of interaction between what I can only assume were friends of the band and the band members themselves.
