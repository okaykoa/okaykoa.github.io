As with most posts, it's tomorrow. But today I feel like saying it instead of saying "today" when I really mean "yesterday."

Yesterday was a tough day. But it was a good day. That friend finally texted me back with a response. She essentially wanted to break ties. She was done with our friendship, she didn't want to explain why, and she didn't want to talk about it or work it out. I was just cut off.

I told her I was sad that she felt that way and that she hadn't told me before. I was sad that she hasn't asked me for my input (how I felt or what I thought) at any point in the conversation. She admitted that this was an unfortunate but valid point and asked me for my thoughts. But because she had said she didn't want to talk about it, I asked if she was really interested in hearing my thoughts; she didn't have to listen to me, she could just end our friendship if that was what she wanted. After that or maybe another text, she asked if we could talk on the phone.

The phone call was difficult. She wanted to hear my thoughts, so I detailed my disappointments again: that I was sad that she hadn't told me and that there was really nothing I could do about it. I wished she wanted to tell me what I had done that had brought her to this point because I would have loved to fix it.

After some hesitant back-and-forth, she did tell me what she was upset about.

There were some mistakes I had made as a friend this year; none of which meritted the her reaction and mistreatment in this conversation. Things like cancelling a couple plans last minute and not making it to a party are not faults that merit terminating a friendship. What had caused her feelings to escalate were the narratives she created around these smaller actions. Narratives about how I didn't want to be her friend, how I was worried that people would think I was unfaithful to my partner if they saw me with a woman in public, how I was spending more time with men rather than women lately. All of these she (at the end of the conversation) admitted were not justified by any evidence beyond a few cancelled plans over the course of 8 months. 

Was it an overreaction, absolutely. There is no denying that. And you, like the few people I have consulted about the issue, might think this is a situation that would merit my exit from the relationship. I think you'd also be right about that.

But in my reflection on this person, our relationship, and myself, I _want_ to be in this relationship still. I want to work to earn this person's trust again. I want to have them in my life and all that goes along with that. I love this person. In my heart, I know what she needs, I know what she deserves. She deserves to be forgiven and understood. 

I know too well the experience of reading too much into a situation that is far simpler than my feelings want me to believe. I know what it's like to think that one person's impatience is a reflection of my self worth. I know what it is to believe I don't deserve to exist.

This kind of thing has happened before, but it doesn't happen often. And I value those years inbetween more than I fear the 3 days, 5 text messages, and 1 phone call that are really difficult. I think the effort is worth the love.
