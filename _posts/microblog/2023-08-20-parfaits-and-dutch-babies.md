Today we started the day with a visit to our friends who live accross town. They are my partner's friends, but they have quickly become folks I rather enjoy spending time with. Many of my interactions with them have been these Sunday breakfasts, sometimes picking things up from a local spot or sometimes (when we're lucky) having something homemade at their house. Today was one such homemade breakfast, with yummy chia and yogurt parfaits and Dutch babies. 

It's always fun to visit these friends because they have a large backyard where McGee (my partner's dog) can run around and explore without the burder of leashing up one of us humans and dragging us along. At one point this morning, McGee came back with extrememly muddy paws from adventuring in the yard to seek a bit of lap time and attention. There is a cute short video of McGee on my lap with his cute muddy paws <3

Into the afternoon and evening, it was just me hanging with McGee while my partner was at work. I felt a little unmotivated and ended up taking a nice Sunday afternoon nap--though the lack of productivity did get to me a little bit. After having that amazing moment yesterday of truly being in a moment and enjoying it for exactly what it was, I was a little disappointed to have such a negative sentiment about relaxation today. Hopefully the structure of the workweek (which, unfortunately enough, starts tomorrow) will have me feeling more myself for the next few days.
