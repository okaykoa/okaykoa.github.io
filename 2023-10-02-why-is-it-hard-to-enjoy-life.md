I'm feeling very good this morning. I'm back in Utah and ready to get back to my normal schedule after travels, which followed recovery from an illness a bit ago. 

I have done a pretty good job this year of being active and losing weight. THe past couple months I haven't done so well. I haven't gained weight in any significant way, but I've been stuck at about 255 pounds. For most people, this would seem like a very heavy weight, but this is the result of over 50 pounds of weight loss for me. And I am still excited and motivated for the progress I will continue to make this year. My goal this entire year has been to get under 240 pounds. At this point, that's looking like its just over 15 pounds away. Light work from the progress I've already made this year. But It will be a challenge still. Weight doesn't melt off of me like it did when I was 300 pounds. Any change in diet or activity was enough to see pretty dramatic results at that weight. I'm still at a weight where weight loss should come pretty naturally with a healthy diet and regular exercise, but the more I lose, the more difficult it will become for me as margine tighten around diet and level of activity. I'm not doubtful, but I do know that at my age and weight, it will be hard work. I'm really excited for the propsect of more fitness and ability to enjoy life. It's been a really good year for me and I'm looking forward to more.

There is a lot going on in my life. There is a lot that I would like to do and create and enjoy. I sometimes struggle to find the time to do all that I would like, and that's okay. Sometimes I do want to slow down and enoy my time too. Do something just for the enjoyment of it and not for the sense of productivity or improvement. That can be really hard to do sometimes. The ego wants me to be good at things, or to justify time spent as "improvement." For some reason, it's very difficult to enjoy something without needing some reason or way to justify it. Justify it from what? Why do I need to justify the way I use my time? It's my time to spend. This is my life, and it's a shame that I have such a hard time allowing myself to enjoy it.

There is a local art collective in Provo called the Arch Hive. I have known about it for a few years and really like some of the stuff they do. Particularly, there is an artist named Camilla whose art I really like. She has done a bit of performance art with this Refill Lake Bonneville movement that I've thought is really funny. A couple months ago they held a protest at the Salt Lake for the ironic political movement. Anyway, the Arch Hive is hosting an art challenge this month called Archtober. They posted a single art prompt for each day of the month of October and have invited anyone to participate and link their challenge on social media. I think I am going to try to participate.
